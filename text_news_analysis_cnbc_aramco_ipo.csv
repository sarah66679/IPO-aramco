"(Adds details)RIYADH, Dec 3 (Reuters) - The institutional tranche of Saudi Aramco’s planned initial public offering (IPO) has been almost three times oversubscribed, receiving orders worth 189.04 billion riyals ($50.4 billion), financial advisers for the IPO said on Tuesday.The bookbuilding process for allocating shares to institutional buyers - typically asset managers, insurers or pension funds - began on Nov. 17 and investors have until 1700 Saudi time on Dec. 4 to place orders.Aramco plans to sell 1.5% of its shares in a deal that could raise up to $25.6 billion.The state-owned Saudi oil giant has received subscription orders for around 6.3 billion of shares so far from institutions in the first 17 days of the IPO, Samba Capital, NCB Capital and HSBC Saudi Arabia said.Typically, IPOs in Saudi Arabia tend to be subscribed many times over, although the unprecedented size of Aramco’s listing means it is harder to benchmark the level of demand.The biggest IPO in Saudi Arabia, before Aramco, was for the National Commercial Bank (NCB) in 2013, which sought to raise $6 billion and was oversubscribed many times over.Aramco has previously said 0.5% of the offering will be allocated to retail investors, leaving 1% - or 2 billion shares - for institutional buyers.The deal could be the world’s biggest IPO if it tops the $25 billion listing of China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014.The lead managers did not provide a breakdown of the institutional investors, but in a separate statement last week Samba Capital said the bulk of orders came from Saudi companies and funds, while foreign investors accounted for just 10.5% of the offers as of Nov. 28.The retail tranche, which closed on that date, attracted bids worth 47.4 billion riyals, equivalent to around 1.5 times the number of shares offered.Riyadh scaled back its original IPO plans, scrapping an international roadshow to focus instead on marketing the offering to wealthy Gulf Arab allies. It has stayed quiet on when or where it might list the stock abroad.The deal is the centrepiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil.($1 = 3.7500 riyals)(Reporting by Marwa Rashad; editing by Lisa Shumaker)",pos
"* OPEC, allies may add 0.4 mln bpd to existing cuts* Moscow still has to approve new policy* Oil prices under pressure from booming U.S. supply (Updates with analysts, prices)DUBAI/LONDON/MOSCOW, Dec 2 (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies plan to deepen oil cuts and have the deal in place so it runs at least until June 2020 as Saudi Arabia wants to deliver a positive surprise to the market before the listing of Saudi Aramco, two sources familiar with the talks said.The deal being discussed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, known as OPEC+, would add at least 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) to existing cuts of 1.2 million bpd or 1.2% of global supply.The current deal runs to March.“They (the Saudis) want to surprise the market,” one of the sources said.Another two sources said the latest OPEC analysis, drawn up by OPEC’s Economic Commission Board (ECB), showed a large oversupply and build up in inventories in the first half of 2020, if no additional cuts were made.Russia, a key non-OPEC ally, has so far opposed deeper cuts or a longer extension. But Moscow has often taken a tough stance before every meeting before approving the policy. Sources said Saudi Arabia was working on convincing Russia.Riyadh needs high oil prices to balance its budget and support the pricing for the Aramco initial public offering (IPO), which could be the world’s biggest.Russia, the world’s second biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, also benefits from a higher oil price and has been working with OPEC on cuts to prevent an oil glut building as a result of booming production from the United States, which has climbed to become the world’s biggest crude producer.Benchmark Brent oil prices rose by more than 2% to nearly $62 per barrel on Monday on the news about the possibility of deeper cuts.Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman heads to Vienna this week for his first OPEC meeting as Saudi Arabia’s energy minister.SEEKING STRICTER COMPLIANCEThe veteran oil official, known as a tough negotiator, wants to ensure oil prices stay high enough for Aramco’s IPO, sources said.The IPO will be priced on Thursday, the same day OPEC meets in Vienna. The OPEC+ grouping holds talks on Friday.Saudi officials, including Prince Abdulaziz, have insisted on stricter compliance with the current cuts, especially as countries such as Iraq and Nigeria have produced well above their quotas, while Riyadh has cut more than demanded.The Saudis are also lobbying other producers to deepen cuts and have been signaling that they are ready to continue taking the biggest burden and to cut well in excess of their target.Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects think-tank, which closely watches OPEC policies, said she believed Riyadh would insist on better compliance by all members before agreeing to further cuts.Saudi Arabia has been cutting more than the amount agreed for most of this year. Its actual cut in November was 783,000 bpd, according to a Reuters survey, a level that was about 400,000 bpd more than its pledged cut of 322,000 bpd.Saudi and Russian oil production costs are much cheaper than those in the United States so any OPEC cut. A price rise can hurt OPEC and its allies because it bolsters U.S. production and allows U.S. shale oil producers to grab a bigger market share.“If WTI goes up to $60 per barrel, there will be more shale,” one of the sources familiar with OPEC talks said, warning against much steeper output cuts.Gary Ross, founder of BlackGold Investors, said it would make sense for Riyadh to support further cuts because of the Aramco IPO and because of forecasts for a oil surplus in 2020.Julius Baer’s Norbert Rucker said that “the most likely outcome next week is an extension of the supply deal for another six months, wrapped in flowery communication leaving the room open for further loose compliance and policy adjustments should market conditions change.”(Additional reporting by Olesya Astakhova and Vladimir Soldatkin in Moscow; Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Edmund Blair)",pos

"(Changes slug, adds details)DUBAI, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul has introduced an equity index cap of 15% which is set to address concerns over the weighting oil giant Saudi Aramco will have when it lists on the exchange.State-owned oil firm Aramco is expected to list 1.5% of its shares this month in a deal which could raise more than $25 billion and top the record initial public offering (IPO) of Chinese retailer Alibaba on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014.The Aramco IPO is seen as a test for the Saudi exchange, where the largest listing so far has been worth $6 billion.“Any constituent whose index weight reaches or exceeds the threshold will be capped in accordance with the set limit,” Tadawul said in a statement on Monday.Aramco is expected to have an initial weight of close to 10% in the Tadawul all-share index (TASI).“This is a precautionary measure to assure investors regarding Aramco’s impact on the Saudi index in case of any further liquidation in the future or in case the stock price goes up,” said Mazen al-Sudairi, head of research at Al Rajhi Capital.The cap would limit the risk of any security representing a large percentage of the index and becoming a major risk for the market, as well as limiting the index’s correlation to the oil price, he added.The move is part of a broader update of Tadawul’s index methodology, including a revision of the free float shares calculation methodology.The new measures will “ensure more balanced indices, which will accurately represent the movement of the market, enhance disclosures and transparency and minimize securities dominance,” Tadawul’s CEO Khalid Al Hussan said in a statement.Tadawul said it had also applied a new “Fast Entry” rule allowing shares of IPOs to be included in the all-share index at the close of their fifth trading day.Currently Al Rajhi Bank has the largest weighting on the TASI at around 16%, followed by National Commercial Bank (NCB) with 7% and petrochemical giant SABIC with 6.8%.Aramco has received $44.3 billion in bids so far from institutional and retail investors for the IPO, lead manager Samba Capital said last week.

In late October, the KIA’s managing director Farouk Bastaki said Aramco had not approached the fund then, but that the KIA would look at the IPO like any other investment.Talks have taken place with sovereign investors including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore’s GIC and other funds, sources have told Reuters.DUBAI ROADSHOWAramco has struggled to attract a major cornerstone or anchor investor for its IPO, which could be potentially the world’s biggest.An executive at a London-based fund, who attended the roadshow in Dubai, told Reuters he was interested in the IPO, but declined to provide more details.Some investors asked Aramco about the sustainability of its dividend policy. Aramco has set a base dividend of $75 billion for five years.A second executive at an investment firm said Aramco did not say whether that base level might grow.The meeting was led by Aramco’s senior vice president of finance, strategy and development, Khaled al-Dabbagh, and Yasser Mufti, the company’s vice president of strategy and market analysis, sources said.“The only thing left for comfort is the Saudi government, its fiscal policy and ability to sustain the dividends,” said a fund manager. “If youre OK with that, youll invest.”Over 20 people, wearing suits, walked into the presentation area at a luxury hotel in Dubai’s financial district, but hotel security restricted entry for reporters.Another roadshow is planned in Abu Dhabi on Monday.“Looks like there’s a lot of interest both from retail investors and institutions.” K.

"* Valuation below Saudi crown prince’s $2 trillion aim* Could be world’s biggest IPO if priced at top of range* Aramco does not plan to market IPO abroad -sources* IPO is centrepiece of plan to diversify from oil (Adds analyst quote)DUBAI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is worth up to $1.7 trillion at the price range set by the oil giant on Sunday, below the $2 trillion sought by Saudi’s crown prince but putting it in the running to become the world’s biggest IPO.Aramco cannot sell its shares directly to investors in the United States and other markets, as the initial public offering (IPO) will be restricted to Saudis and those foreign institutions permitted to invest in the kingdom’s stock market.The oil giant said it plans to sell 1.5% of the company, or about 3 billion shares, at an indicative price range of 30 riyals to 32 riyals, valuing the IPO at as much as 96 billion riyals ($25.6 billion) and giving the company a potential market value of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion.This could just beat Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba’s record $25 billion New York stock market debut in 2014.Aramco’s IPO size could be bigger if there is enough demand for it to use a 15% “greenshoe” over-allotment option.“We are planning to subscribe to the IPO in two funds that we manage,” said Zachary Cefaratti, chief executive officer of Dubai-based Dalma Capital Management Ltd, adding that the preliminary valuation was “in line with our expectations”.Aramco kicked off its IPO on Nov. 3 after a series of false starts. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who floated the idea nearly four years ago, is seeking to raise billions of dollars to invest in non-oil industries, create employment and diversify the world’s top crude exporter away from oil.In its original prospectus, published on Nov. 9, Aramco said the domestic IPO would be made to institutional investors outside the United States according to Regulation S of the United States Securities Act of 1933, and inside the United States under the Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act.But on Sunday in an addendum to the IPO prospectus Aramco said that it had removed any reference to such regulations, which three people familiar with the matter said suggested there would not be any international roadshows to market the shares.“I expect this is a reflection of poor international demand,” said Rory Fyfe, managing director at MENA Advisors.“It was not worth it from their view. If there’s no substantial value or demand why do it and take additional legal risk?,” a banker familiar with the matter told Reuters.Aramco is yet to name any cornerstone investors in the deal or formally disclose the listing date.Analysts from banks working on the Riyadh bourse had given a valuation range of $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion for Aramco’s IPO and the fall from Crown Prince Mohammed’s original target underscores the challenges facing the company.The Crown Prince’s reputation was tarnished by the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, while Aramco’s oil plants were targeted in September by attacks which initially halved its output. It has said the strikes will not have a material impact on its business.Aramco is the world’s most profitable company with a planned dividend of $75 billion next year, more than five times larger than the payout by Apple, the biggest of any S&P 500 company.But it is a bet on the price of oil at a time when global demand is expected to slow from 2025 due to measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions and rising use of electric vehicles.There is also political risk as the Saudi government, which relies on Aramco for the bulk of its funding, will continue to control the company.HIT AT HOMEDespite questions abroad, Aramco’s IPO is expected to be a huge hit among Saudis who are being offered 0.5% of the company.Retail investors have until Nov. 28 to sign up for the IPO while institutional investors can subscribe until Dec. 4.The Aramco listing is part of a year-end equity market rush, with Alibaba taking orders for a Hong Kong listing that is expected to raise up to $13.4 billion.The Riyadh listing comes after initial hopes for a 5% IPO on the domestic and international bourses were dashed last year amid debate over valuation and where to list Aramco.Aramco said the IPO timetable was delayed because it began a process to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp.Aramco mandated 27 banks to work on the deal, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.

"* Malaysia's state oil firm says not taking part* Russia's Lukoil says won't be buying shares* Aramco yet to reveal any major foreign interest (Adds background on other sovereign investors, quotes, background)KUALA LUMPUR/LONDON Nov 22 (Reuters) - With Saudi Aramco yet to name any major foreign investors in its upcoming share sale, Malaysia's state energy company Petronas decided to take a pass on Friday.Expectations that Aramco customers and allies around the world would take significant stakes in the company have so far not materialised, with the listing looking like it will be reliant on local retail and institutional investors.Petronas follows Russia's second largest oil producer Lukoil in turning its back on the initial public offering (IPO) which is likely to rank Aramco as the world's most valuable company.Petronas and Aramco have a joint venture in a $27 billion refinery and petrochemicals complex in southern Malaysia that is set to start commercial operations this year.Aramco kicked off the sale process on Nov. 3 after a series of false starts and Petronas, which has a joint venture with the Saudi firm in Malaysia, said it had been asked to invest.""Petronas would like to confirm that after due consideration, the company has decided not to participate in Saudi Aramco's initial public offering exercise,"" Petronas said in an emailed statement.Aramco is a major oil supplier to China, Japan and South Korea and their plans for the IPO are not yet clear, however, the head of Japan's largest refiner said earlier this month that Japanese companies were unlikely to invest because it was difficult to ascertain Aramco's true value.Aramco plans to sell 1.5% of the company, looking to raise up to $25.6 billion and giving the company a potential market value of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion.It is the centrepiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from its reliance on oil.But the company has cancelled marketing roadshows for its listing outside of the Gulf because of the lack of interest from foreign institutional investors.That has raised questions about to what extent the listing can really diversify the country's economic interests.""Just selling a 1.5% stake in an oil company is not really going to achieve an enormous amount,"" said Charles Hollis, a former UK-Saudi diplomat and director at intelligence consultancy Falanx Assynt.Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment on potential anchor investments or the impact its IPO will have on diversifying the economy.Saudi Arabia's Samba Financial Group said on Thursday that the IPO has attracted about 73 billion riyals ($19.47 billion) in institutional and retail orders so far.Although no major state company or fund has stepped forward, talks have been taking place with sovereign investors including the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore's GIC and other funds, sources have told Reuters.

"trillion valuation: Russell@ (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)* GRAPHIC: Saudi Aramco's IPO: https://tmsnrt.rs/33gWypMNov 18 - The market focus on the valuation of Saudi Aramco's initial public offering is similar to Bugatti Chiron owners focusing on their vehicles' top speeds - interesting, but of little relevance.The $1.7 trillion upper value placed on the Saudi state oil company, the world's largest crude exporter, will no doubt generate speculation as to whether it's too high, and whether it will be viewed as reasonable enough to attract interest beyond the kingdom's small domestic equity market.But these discussions are largely irrelevant for the crude oil market.By far the most important question for crude markets is whether the IPO of Aramco <IPO-ARMO.SE> will alter the behavior of the oil giant in any meaningful way likely to make an impact on market dynamics?Initial indications are no, and the market expectation is that Aramco will continue to behave in much the same manner as it currently does.In other words, the Saudis will remain the key player in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which is engaged in a long-running effort, in conjunction with allied producers such as Russia, to boost crude prices.But the crude market's complacency over Aramco turning into a public company may be slightly misplaced.The first thing to note is that the company has committed to paying an annual dividend of at least $75 billion for the next five years.This means Aramco will be under some pressure to maintain its existing strong profitability, and this may influence how the company's executives view their role in global oil markets.For instance, picture a scenario where U.S. shale output continues to grow, as well as output from other producers outside the OPEC-plus-allies agreement.Will Aramco continue to advocate for output cuts by OPEC and its allies, or will it be tempted to run the numbers on once again chasing volume over value, given its inherent advantage of being the lowest-cost major oil producer?Aramco is also likely to have to become somewhat more transparent in its interactions with the market.The company is currently has a reputation of being quite secretive in its public dealings. For instance, it doesn't discuss its pricing or strategies.However, investors are likely to want more details of Aramco's inner workings as they try to assess whether the company is worth buying into, and whether it can deliver upon its stated aims.IPO PRESSUREThe nature of Aramco's very limited IPO may also influence the company's behavior, given the view of some analysts that the offering may be priced too richly.The valuation of between 30 riyals and 32 riyals ($8-$8.50) a share for the IPO - a date for which has still to be confirmed - will value Aramco at between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion.This is well below the $2 trillion apparently sought by Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but also well above the range of many Western investment banks.The IPO is only for 1.5% of the company's shares and is only open to Saudi citizens and those foreigners qualified to invest in the kingdom. That means vast numbers of potential investors won't be able to participate, even if they wanted to.Nonetheless, the pressure will be on for the shares to rise in the weeks and months following the IPO to show that it has been successful, and that Aramco justifies a higher market valuation than what many investment banks currently believe.It also means that Aramco will be under pressure to deliver on earnings and dividends - and the best way of achieving that is through higher crude prices.While the state of the global economy is beyond the control of the Saudis, the current conditions in the crude oil market are somewhat concerning.Demand growth has been weak this year, and if it weren't for surging Chinese imports there would be hardly any additional crude demand this year.Supply growth continues in the United States and elsewhere, making a sustained increase in crude oil prices unlikely.For the crude oil market, much as for supercars in the real world, the important questions are how fast Aramco can accelerate, and how well it handles the road ahead?

"* Saudi oil output edges lower after Oct recovery* Nigeria still exceeds quota by largest margin* Angolan output posts biggest drop due to maintenance* Output by country, compliance: (Adds graphic on pledged and actual cuts)LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - OPEC oil output has fallen in November as Angolan production has slipped due to maintenance and Saudi Arabia has kept a lid on supply to support the market before the initial public offering (IPO) of state-owned Saudi Aramco, a Reuters survey found.On average, the 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 29.57 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, according to the survey. That is down 110,000 bpd from October’s revised figure.The survey suggests Saudi Arabia, after resuming normal supply after attacks on facilities in September, is still pumping far less than an OPEC-led supply deal allows. OPEC meets to review the pact on Dec. 5, the same day Aramco is due to announce the final offer price.OPEC, Russia and other allies, known as OPEC+, agreed to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1. OPEC’s share of the cut is about 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members, with exemptions for Iran, Libya and Venezuela.The producers are expected to extend their supply pact at meetings on Dec. 5-6. OPEC delegates have said the producers could discuss deeper supply cuts amid forecasts of excess supply in 2020.“The minimum is to extend,” said an OPEC delegate.Oil has slipped to $63 a barrel after spiking to $72 following the Sept. 14 attacks on Saudi oil plants. The current price is below the levels many OPEC countries need to balance their budgets and below the levels officials say they favour.The 11 OPEC members bound by the agreement, which for now runs until March 2020, have easily exceeded the pledged cuts. Compliance has risen to 152% in November, the survey found, from 135% in October, although Iraq and Nigeria remain laggards among larger producers.ANGOLAN DROPOPEC’s largest production drop of 140,000 bpd was in Angola, which exported less crude in November due to maintenance affecting the Girassol crude stream, traders said.The African producer was already pumping far below its OPEC quota due to a natural decline in production and a lack of new fields coming online, rather than due to voluntary restraint.Saudi Arabia has pumped 9.85 million bpd, down 50,000 bpd from October, the survey found.Riyadh’s output had jumped by 850,000 bpd in October after the September attacks, but remained below Saudi Arabia’s OPEC quota. In November, the country has been pumping more than 400,000 bpd less than the agreement allows, the survey found.OPEC’s second-largest producer Iraq has pumped slightly less, but continues to overshoot its target.Nigeria, which has consistently pumped more than its OPEC target, continued to do so in November, the survey found, although output has edged lower this month.Among countries pumping more, the largest increase was in Kuwait, which increased output by 70,000 bpd to 2.72 million bpd, reaching its exact quota level.Ecuador also pumped more after a decline in October, when protests against government austerity measures led to several fields being shut down.Venezuela, which is contending with U.S. sanctions imposed on state oil firm PDVSA and a long-term decline in output, managed a small boost to supply with exports increasing in November.Production from the two other exempt producers, Libya and Iran, was little changed.The Reuters survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Refinitiv Eikon flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.(Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal; Editing by Edmund Blair and Louise Heavens)",neg

"* 25 banks to earn combined fees of $90 million or less* Payout for Aramco IPO lags Alibaba and Facebook deals* Comes after company revises down valuation, offer size* Relatively slim reward for what could be biggest IPO ever (Adds details) DeninaDUBAI/LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - After battling it out for a role in a giant IPO that promised to make history, and enduring delay after delay, investment banks advising Saudi Aramco are set to be rewarded with relatively slim pickings.The 25 banks working on the listing will earn combined fees of $90 million or less, according to three sources involved in the deal, after the oil company scaled back its ambitions.That fee pool is dwarfed by the $300 million paid out by Chinese retail titan Alibaba for its 2014 listing in New York. It also significantly trails the estimated $176 million shelled out by Facebook for its 2012 IPO.Almost four years since Saudi Arabia announced plans to list its oil champion, Aramco is finally going public, but in Riyadh rather than a global financial hub like London or New York.The company was always expected to pay less lucrative rates than the likes of Alibaba and Facebook, given it is a state firm and the initial public offering was seen as a gateway to other lucrative deals in the kingdom. But its sheer size, and anticipation that international investors would scramble for a slice of the world's most profitable company, meant banks would have expected a far higher return.However Saudi Arabia has pared back its own ambitions.Riyadh originally put the state company's value at $2 trillion, but this has been revised down to a maximum of $1.7 trillion. Aramco decided on Sunday that it also would offer only 1.5% of the company - below the expected 2%.The world's top oil exporter also canceled marketing events in developed markets like the United States and Britain, turning its back on most international investment and instead primarily targeting Saudi investors.The banks will be paid 0.35% of the money raised, according to the three sources. This would be around $90 million if the company prices at the top of its range, raising $25.6 billion - still making it the biggest IPO in history.If bankers had met certain milestones, including helping Aramco achieve a $2 trillion valuation and sell 2% of the company - now impossible feats - the banks would have been entitled to be paid 0.5%, the three sources said.That meant fees could have been in excess of $200 million.Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Alibaba had 35 banks working on its 2014 deal, and paid fees totalling 1.2% of the $25 billion raised. Facebook, meanwhile, paid around 30 banks 1.1% of the $16 billion raised in its IPO.FIERCE COMPETITIONThe lead nine lead banks will likely get the bulk of fees. They include Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan as well as Saudi players National Commercial Bank, SAMBA Financial Group.Some of the international junior bookrunners could walk away with very little as share sales to non-Saudi investors will be limited.One of three sources said that Aramco on Sunday gave banks a 76-hour deadline to confirm whether they would stay on the deal.Some banks are still trying to secure investment from Western funds, a fourth source said, adding it was unlikely that Aramco would ditch any banks at this advanced stage unless they asked to drop out.One consolation could be that the listing will at least help their standing in equity capital market league tables. Investment banks have competed fiercely for mandates from Aramco ever since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2016 announced a plan to sell a 5% stake, including in an overseas listing, as a cornerstone of an ambitious drive to diversify the economy of the world's largest oil exporter.Aramco said it postponed a listing in 2018 to acquire 70% of petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries, a move seen as a bid to boost the firm's valuation.Preparations were revived this summer after the firm attracted huge interest in its first international bond sale, seen as a pre-IPO relationship-building exercise with investors, and the company began mandating the large number of banks.NO GLOBETROTTINGBankers had anticipated spending much of this week globetrotting with Aramco management round meetings with investors  a presentation had been scheduled for Wednesday at London's Savoy Hotel and on Thursday at the St Regis in New York according to invitations seen by Reuters.But all marketing events outside the Middle East region were canceled on Saturday.""Almost all of the book will be domestic, although some QFIs may come,"" a fifth source said, referring to Qualified Foreign Investors allowed to invest in Saudi securities.However foreign funds do not tend to value Saudi companies as highly as local investors, partly because they are wary of regional risks, the source said.Such risks came to the fore when Aramco's facilities were attacked in September, initially halving oil output. Saudi Arabia blamed arch-rival Iran, which denied involvement.Saudi banks such as National Commercial Bank, SAMBA and Al Rajhi will cash in on selling the bulk of shares to locals and providing them with financing.

"DeninaDUBAI/LONDON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - The army of banks working on Saudi Aramco's listing will earn combined fees of $90 million or less, according to three sources involved in the process, after the oil giant scaled back a deal initially viewed as a golden opportunity for high finance.The fee pool for the flotation of the world's most profitable company contrasts with other blockbuster listings in recent years. China's Alibaba, for example, paid out an estimated $300 million for its 2014 listing in New York.The 25 banks hired by Aramco as bookrunners for its domestic initial public offering (IPO) have seen their projected payouts dwindle despite spending years working on the much-delayed marquee listing.Saudi Arabia originally put the state company's value at $2 trillion, but this was revised down to a maximum of $1.7 trillion.

Facebook, meanwhile, paid out an estimated $176 million to 30 banks for its 2012 IPO, which raised $16 billion.While Aramco was always anticipated to pay a less lucrative rate, the sheer volume of shares on sale and expectation there would be sizeable participation by international investors meant banks would have expected a far higher return.FIERCE COMPETITIONThe lead nine lead banks will likely get the bulk of fees.

Investment banks have competed fiercely for mandates from Aramco ever since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2016 announced a plan to sell a 5% stake, including in an overseas listing, as a cornerstone of an ambitious drive to diversify the economy of the world's largest oil exporter.Aramco said it postponed a listing in 2018 to acquire 70% of petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries, a move seen as a bid to boost the firm's valuation.Preparations were revived this summer after the firm attracted huge interest in its first international bond sale, seen as a pre-IPO relationship-building exercise with investors, and the company began mandating the large number of banks.NO GLOBETROTTINGBankers had anticipated spending much of this week globetrotting with Aramco management round meetings with investors  a presentation had been scheduled for Wednesday at London's Savoy Hotel and on Thursday at the St Regis in New York according to invitations seen by Reuters.But all marketing events outside the Middle East region were cancelled on Saturday.""Almost all of the book will be domestic, although some QFIs may come,"" a fifth source said, referring to Qualified Foreign Investors allowed to invest in Saudi securities.However foreign funds do not tend to value Saudi companies as highly as local investors, partly because they are wary of regional risks, the source said.Such risks came to the fore when Aramco's facilities were attacked in September, initially halving oil output. Saudi Arabia blamed arch-rival Iran, which denied involvement.Saudi banks such as National Commercial Bank, SAMBA and Al Rajhi will cash in on selling the bulk of shares to locals and providing them with financing.

"(Adds Samba, banking source quotes)RIYADH/DUBAI, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO) has attracted approximately 73 billion riyals ($19.47 billion) in institutional and retail orders so far, Saudi Arabia’s Samba Financial Group said on Thursday.Some 1.8 million retail subscribers have injected more than 14 billion riyals into the IPO so far, Samba, one of the banks managing the deal, said in a statement sent to Reuters.Institutional subscriptions amounted to 58.4 billion riyals and 1.82 billion subscribed shares, it added.“Retail and Institutional subscription levels for the first five days of the offering have reached an unprecedented scale, demonstrating the confidence of investors in Saudi Aramco,” said Rania Nashar, vice chairman of Samba Capital, the investment arm of the bank, in the statement.“We anticipate further increases in subscription levels during the remainder of the offering period.”A banking source told Reuters earlier that the institutional tranche of the IPO was oversubscribed. However, the preliminary estimates do not show that it is oversubscribed.“Receiving banks send their statistics (by) the end of the day, some are late for technical or bureaucratic reasons, that is what makes the different figures,” the source said.“The order book shows very good signs the IPO will be oversubscribed.”Aramco, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, plans to sell 1.5% of the company, or about 3 billion shares, at an indicative price range of 30 riyals to 32 riyals, valuing the IPO at as much as 96 billion riyals and giving the company a potential market value of between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion.Representatives of the state-owned oil giant plan meetings with investors in Dubai next week, sources have said, for what is expected to be the world’s biggest share sale.Aramco has said at least one-third of the sale is expected to be covered by retail investors, who have until Nov. 28 to sign up for the IPO.Institutional investors can subscribe until Dec. 4.Aramco kicked off the sale process on Nov. 3 after a series of false starts. The deal is crucial for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans to raise billions of dollars to invest in non-oil industries, create employment and diversify the world’s top crude exporter away from oil.

"-sources@DUBAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is looking to sell up to 0.5% of the state oil giant to retail investors in its planned initial public offering (IPO), three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The Saudi oil group has not yet revealed the size of its planned IPO or what proportion of the company it will float, although sources have previously said this could be 1-2%.Aramco declined to comment.It is expected to release more details about the company in an IPO prospectus document later on Saturday.Assuming Aramco achieves a total valuation of $2 trillion, the retail tranche could be worth around $10 billion, the sources said on Saturday.Aramco fired the starting gun on the domestic IPO last week after a series of false starts. It did not give details on how much would be sold, or when the listing would happen, while expert valuations vary from $1.2 to $2.3 trillion.A government committee has met in the past few months with dozens of wealthy Saudi individuals to secure pre-sale agreements, sources told Reuters last month.And the government has encouraged investors to repatriate cash held overseas to buy into the IPO to avoid draining too much liquidity from the Saudi banking system, they said.Reuters reported on Oct. 17 that Aramco can take advantage of new market rules that allow issuers the flexibility to sell more shares to retail investors, likely exceeding the usual 10% seen in recent IPOs.""Local demand is strong,"" a second source said on Saturday, adding that this would lead institutional investors to think that up to 75% of the IPO would be available for them.

"scant details@* Aramco could sell 1%-2% on Saudi bourse-sources* It plans to create the world’s most valuable listed company* IPO aimed at diversifying economy away from oil (Adds analyst comment, updates stock market quote) BarbusciaDHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia/DUBAI, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s giant state oil company finally kick-started its initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday, announcing its intention to float on the domestic bourse in what could be the world’s biggest listing as the kingdom seeks to diversify its economy away from oil.But in its long-awaited announcement, Aramco, the world’s most profitable company, offered few specifics on the number of shares to be sold, pricing or the date for a launch.Bankers have told the Saudi government that investors will likely value the company at around $1.5 trillion, below the $2 trillion valuation touted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman when he first floated the idea of an IPO nearly four years ago.Aramco also did not mention what measures it has taken to beef up security following unprecedented attacks on its oil plants in September.Sources have told Reuters the oil company could offer 1%-2% of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much as $20 billion-$40 billion. A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking one of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.“Today is the right opportunity for new investors to reap the benefits of Aramco’s ability to achieve value, and boost it on the long-term,” Aramco Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan told a news conference at the company’s headquarters in the eastern city of Dhahran.The company will spend the next 10 days talking to investors and sounding out their interest and the price range will follow, he said.The IPO is designed to turbocharge Prince Mohammed’s ambitious economic reform agenda by raising billions to build non-energy industries and diversify revenue streams.Rumayyan said a decision on an international listing for Aramco shares will be made in the future, without giving a time frame or venue for the overseas listing.“Selling a small piece of Aramco in a captive market gives the KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) more control to prop the value of Aramco up over its fair value,” said Gary Ross, CEO at Black Gold Investors.Confirmation of the sale of shares in the oil giant, whose formal name is Saudi Arabian Oil Co, comes about seven weeks after the crippling attacks on its oil facilities, underlining Saudi Arabia’s determination to push on with the listing regardless.Aramco said it does not expect the Sept. 14 attack, which targeted plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry and initially halved its production, would have a material impact on its business, operations and financial condition.Aramco accounted for about one in every eight barrels of crude oil produced globally from 2016 to 2018, it said on Sunday.Its net income for the third quarter of 2019 amounted to $21.1 billion, according to Reuters calculations, dwarfing the income for the same period of oil giants like Exxon Mobil Corp , which was just over $3 billion.Rumayyan said the valuation should be determined after the investor roadshow.

The benchmark index is down nearly a fifth since May as local institutions sold shares to prepare for the Aramco deal, fund managers and analysts say.Salah Shamma, head of investment, MENA, at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity, said some local investors could be selling other shares in order to shift investments to Aramco, but this could well be a case of “short-term pain for long-term gain.”To comfort investors, Aramco said on Sunday the state will forgo its right to receive a portion of cash dividends on shares, giving priority to new shareholders.Aramco is also cutting royalties it pays to the state. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, it will adopt a progressive royalty scheme, with a marginal rate set at 15% up to $70 per barrel, 45% between $70 and $100, and 80% if the price rises higher.The firm said the Saudi market regulator, which approved the application to list on Sunday, issued an exemption for non-resident institutional foreign investors to subscribe.Saudi investors would be eligible to receive bonus shares - a maximum of 100 bonus shares for every 10 allotted shares.At a valuation of $1.5 trillion, Aramco would still be worth at least 50% more than the world’s most valuable listed companies, Microsoft and Apple, which each have a market capitalisation of about $1 trillion.But a 1% sale would raise “only” around $15 billion for Saudi coffers, ranking Aramco as the 11th biggest IPO of all time, Refinitiv data show.

"Nov 8, TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies are unlikely to invest in Saudi Aramco's blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) because it is difficult to evaluate the value of the world's biggest oil company, the head of Japan's largest refiner said on Friday.The unusually frank remarks from the head of a typically conservative Japanese company underscore potential challenges for the IPO, which Aramco has announced is going ahead although the state-owned oil giant has released few details.Sources have told Reuters that Aramco could offer 1%-2% of its shares, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion. A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking IPO of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.""It's difficult to think that many Japanese investors will make investments,"" JXTG Holdings President Tsutomu Sugimori said at an earnings briefing.""Japanese companies have stakeholders and they need good reasons to explain to shareholders why they would make such hefty investments and we need to do strict due diligence.""He was responding to a question on whether Japanese companies would follow Chinese investors, after Bloomberg reported that Chinese state-owned firms, including Sinopec Corp, were considering investing up to $10 billion in the Aramco <IPO-ARMO.SE> share offer.""We don't know about Aramco's crude oil reserves and how their contracts with the Saudi royal family work and so on. Aramco will need to disclose this information, but it is not clear how open Aramco will become,"" Sugimori said.Aramco, the world's most profitable company, said on Sunday it was kicking off a domestic IPO, with scant details disclosed and expert valuations varying from around $1.2 to $2.3 trillion.JXTG and other Japanese refiners have longstanding relationships with Aramco, having been big buyers of Saudi crude for decades, although Japan's oil imports have fallen as a declining population uses more efficient automobiles.Aramco supplied almost 36% of Japan's crude imports in September, which totalled 2.8 million barrels per day.The Saudi oil company owns a 7.65% stake in Idemitsu Co, Japan's second-largest refiner, according the Japanese company's website.(Reporting by Yuka Obayashi; Writing by Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Edmund Blair)",neg
"* Saudi exchange Tadawul says it is ready for Aramco IPO* But experts warn of possible technical, liquidity problems* Saudi Aramco itself has warned IPO could disrupt tradingRIYADH/DUBAI, Nov 12 (Reuters) - The imminent listing of oil giant Aramco will be a pivotal moment for Saudi Arabia's young and untested Tadawul stock exchange.The Tadawul has said it has been preparing for years and is primed for the long-awaited share sale in coming weeks. But hosting possibly the biggest initial public offering in history represents a huge leap into the big league for a 12-year-old exchange that only admitted foreign investors four years ago.Mega-IPOs have a record of causing technical glitches on stock markets as they can lead to a surge in trading orders that swamp an exchange's system and can prevent investors from buying or selling stock.Facebook's 2012 listing on Nasdaq, for example, was hit by widespread delays and problems processing the huge volume of orders. And that was a smaller IPO than Aramco's is expected to be, on a marquee exchange with more than four decades of experience; the Nasdaq Composite index today hosts more than $13 trillion worth of shares, according to Refinitiv data, about 27 times the Tadawul's roughly $500 billion.Any technical or liquidity problems could deal a blow to the Tadawul's credibility, industry experts say.""You have to have really robust technology in order to support the spike that's expected with a high-profile IPO,"" said Spencer Mindlin, an analyst at Aite Group.For an exchange in an emerging market like Saudi Arabia, the Aramco IPO arguably carries more risk than for an exchange in a country with a more developed capital markets infrastructure, because the IPO will set the tone for the market, he added.The Tadawul did not respond to a request for comment on its preparedness for the sale.The exchange might argue though that it has learned from missteps made elsewhere in big listings like Facebook's.It brought in a new trading platform developed by Nasdaq in 2015, while last year Saudi Arabia's Capital Market Authority introduced a price stabilisation mechanism to prevent large share price drops in newly listed companies.Nonetheless, uncertainty around the exchange's ability to digest the bumper listing represents another potential hazard for investors already rattled by a September attack on Aramco's facilities that underlined the geopolitical risk associated with the state oil company.Some advisers working on the IPO say the Saudi stock market's ability to handle the deal was one of the main questions coming from investors.""They're asking who are the cornerstones, is there liquidity in the market, how much will be leveraged, is there any potential risks with margin calls?"" said one banker, who asked not to be named as he is not authorised to speak publicly.ARAMCO FLAGS RISKSShare sales of the world's most profitable company will begin on Nov. 17, according to the IPO prospectus published on Saturday.Aramco could offer 1%-2% of its shares, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion, sources have told Reuters. A deal over $25 billion would top the record IPO of Chinese retail titan Alibaba on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014.The Saudi exchange has been bullish, with its boss Khalid al-Hussan saying this month that it was ""ready to receive the largest listing in the history of financial markets"".But Aramco itself has warned the transaction could disrupt trading on the exchange, where the largest listing so far has been worth $6 billion.In its IPO prospectus, the company said recent changes to trading mechanisms, to modernise the platform and align with international standards, were ""untested and there can be no assurance that they will adequately facilitate the listing of and expected high trading volume in the shares"".The changes mean there is now a smaller window between when a company's shares are priced, sold and then admitted to trading, which could risk a delay to the listing, the prospectus said.The past two years have seen several major investment banks join the exchange as members including Goldman Sachs and Citi, meaning they can broker and deal there, providing more outlets to help investors to trade.But volume on the market this year so far is sluggish.In 2015, when foreign funds started buying Saudi stocks, the average daily traded value was $1.8 billion. After a sell-off in Saudi stocks in October 2018 following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, volume dwindled, with average traded value in 2019 at $900 million a day.""They (the Tadawul) have been working over the past couple of years on improving the market and making it ready for Aramco's IPO, however I don't think they have done stress tests yet,"" said Saudi economist Fadl Alboainain.'PLENTY OF DRY POWDER'To avoid the risk of a slew of sell orders hitting the exchange following the IPO - companies listing usually aim for a bounce on their debut followed by relatively steady trading - Aramco plans to grant bonus shares to Saudi retail investors who keep the stock for six months. The Saudi government has also committed not to sell any more shares for at least a year. Retail investors, who could snap up as much as a quarter of the shares put up for sale, say they have been preparing for months by saving money, selling land plots and exiting other stocks.Their attitude could be crucial to how the stock trades as it is still unclear how many international funds will take part in the listing.Saudi Arabia's inclusion in the MSCI developing-economies equity benchmark this year has failed to pull in active emerging-market funds because of high valuations and reputational risks, an analysis by Copley Fund Research showed.One reason investors kept their distance was the murder of Khashoggi, said Steven Holden, CEO of Copley Fund Research.However, he added: ""The massive underweight does imply there is plenty of dry powder in emerging market portfolios to deploy on Aramco.""($1 = 3.7501 riyals)(Additional reporting by Saeed Azhar and Hadeel Al Sayegh in Dubai, and John McCrank in New York; Editing by Pravin Char)",pos
"target - sources@ (Adds confirmation of deal launch decision in fourth paragraph)DUBAI, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco officials and advisers are holding last-minute meetings with investors in an attempt to achieve as close to a $2 trillion valuation ahead of an expected Sunday announcement that the initial public offering (IPO) will go ahead, according to three sources.Failure to reach the target would cause a dilemma for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - swallow the bitter pill of going ahead at a lower valuation or postpone the initial public offering (IPO) once again.The Aramco officials and advisers are meeting institutional investors around the world, according to the three people familiar with the matter. Chief executive Amin Nasser has been meeting investors in New York and London this week, they added.Saudi Arabia's crown prince on Friday approved the go ahead of the IPO of state oil giant Aramco, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The main sticking point remains the $2 trillion valuation, which has often been considered too ambitious by advisers and some insiders, according to the three sources. A valuation closer to $1.5 trillion is more likely, with wealthy Saudi families the main investors in the IPO, they said.""Saudi Aramco does not comment on rumours or speculations,"" the company said in an emailed response to Reuters' queries about the meetings and IPO launch date. Aramco added it was ready for the IPO, and that the timing would depend on market conditions.Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz said on Wednesday that it would be a Saudi decision, specifically by Crown Prince Mohammed.A weak outlook for oil prices, against a gloomy global economic picture and increasing climate change activism, could dampen investor interest, particularly in the Western world.""Aramco's officials and advisers are still on the road,"" said one of the sources, a major institutional investor.Saudi Arabia is separately still holding government-to-government meetings to attract investment from sovereign wealth funds, the investor added.The state-owned oil major has also approached governments in the Gulf and Asia, including China, to try to secure the bulk of the investment from countries on friendly terms with Saudi Arabia, as the reception elsewhere has been cooler, sources have previously said.DIVIDEND PAYOUTThe listing is the centrepiece of the crown prince's plan to shake up the Saudi economy and diversify away from oil. But there have been various delays since the 2016 announcement. A launch is now expected on Sunday, sources have previously said.Aramco has said it will pay a base dividend of $75 billion, which at $2 trillion would mean a dividend yield of 3.75%, below those already offered by competitors like Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell.Shell's dividend yield is over 6% and Exxon's over 5%, according to Refinitiv data.Oil majors have been raising payouts to shareholders over the past years to counter rising pressure from climate activism on investors to dump oil stocks and help the world switch to cleaner fuels such as wind and solar.To achieve $2 trillion, in the largest IPO in history, Riyadh needs the initial listing of a 1% to 2% stake on the Saudi market to raise at least $20 billion to $40 billion.Prince Mohammed wants to eventually list a total of 5% of the company. An international sale is expected to follow the domestic IPO.The close relationship between new Aramco chairman Yasser al-Rumayyan, who also heads the PIF, the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, with the crown prince was a governance concern of some investors, the sources said.The PIF (Public Investment Fund) will use the proceeds of the Aramco IPO sale to deliver on the prince's ambitious domestic and economic reforms.

"* Aramco could sell 1%-2% on Saudi bourse-sources* It plans to create the world's most valuable listed company* IPO aimed at diversifying economy away from oil (Adds quotes from Aramco news conference, analysts, Saudi stocks) BarbusciaDHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia/DUBAI, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's giant state oil company finally kick-started its initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday, announcing its intention to float on the domestic bourse in what could be the world's biggest listing as the kingdom seeks to diversify its economy away from oil.But in its long-awaited announcement, Aramco, the world's most profitable company, offered few specifics on the number of shares to be sold, pricing or the date for a launch.Bankers have told the Saudi government that investors will likely value the company at around $1.5 trillion, below the $2 trillion valuation touted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman when he first floated the idea of an IPO nearly four years ago.Aramco also did not mention what measures it has taken to beef up security following unprecedented attacks on its oil plants in September.Sources have told Reuters the oil company could offer 1%-2% of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much as $20 billion-$40 billion. A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking one of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.""Today is the right opportunity for new investors to reap the benefits of Aramco's ability to achieve value, and boost it on the long-term,"" Aramco Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan told a news conference at the company's headquarters in the eastern city of Dhahran.The company will spend the next 10 days talking to investors and sounding out their interest and the price range will follow, he said.The IPO is designed to turbocharge Prince Mohammed's ambitious economic reform agenda by raising billions to build non-energy industries and diversify revenue streams in Saudi Arabia.Confirmation of the sale of shares in the oil giant, whose formal name is Saudi Arabian Oil Co, comes about seven weeks after the crippling attacks on its oil facilities, underlining Saudi Arabia's determination to push on with the listing regardless.Aramco said it does not expect the Sept. 14 attack, which targeted plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry and initially halved its production, would have a material impact on its business, operations and financial condition.Aramco accounted for about one in every eight barrels of crude oil produced globally from 2016 to 2018, it said on Sunday.Its net income for the third quarter of 2019 amounted to $21.1 billion, according to Reuters calculations, dwarfing the income for the same period of oil giants like Exxon Mobil Corp , which was just over $3 billion.Rumayyan said the valuation should be determined after the investor roadshow.

"DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia — The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia officially launched its initial public offering (IPO) for its state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco on Sunday, announcing that a domestic listing will happen in December.The kingdom's market regulator approved the listing early Sunday but exact details surrounding the size and scope of the IPO remain unknown. In a statement from Saudi Aramco, the company said ""the final offer price, number of shares to be sold and percentage of the shares to be sold will be determined at the end of the book-building period.""Amin Nasser, president and chief executive of Saudi Aramco, said in a statement that the company's vision ""is to be the world's pre-eminent integrated energy and chemicals company.""""Our mission is to provide our shareholders with long-term value creation through crude oil price cycles by maintaining our pre-eminence in oil and gas production, capturing additional value across the hydrocarbon value chain and profitably growing our portfolio,"" he said.In a follow-up press conference on Sunday, Nasser said the company's IPO prospectus would be released on November 9 and told CNBC that the listing of Aramco was to help diversify the economy, and was a way to strengthen the domestic Tadawul exchange by attracting both domestic and international investment.""For us, as Saudi Aramco, I think we are proud of the listing of Aramco. It will increase our visibility internationally. We are a very strong company. By sharing a lot of information, as required by any listed company, there will be a lot of analysts that will review our data and compare it with other listed companies, and we would love to have that kind of comparisons, because we are a company that are proud of our results,"" he said.Also at the press conference, Aramco's Chairman Yasser al-Rumayyan said the international listing would be decided on ""going forward."" He also said he could not comment on the valuation of the company, or the percentage to list.He told CNBC that the company was a safe bet for investors despite some concerns over the security of Saudi oil infrastructure following a drone and missile attack on Aramco facilities in September.""We have also the resilience of the company, and it was really demonstrated in the September 14th attacks ... We have one eighth of the oil production in the world, and the oil traders, they saw this as a one-off event, and that means it is really safe. That's what the money is saying. So the safety, I think the whole wide world it's not only Saudi Arabia, will be looking after the safety of this region and this company,"" he said.Previous reports have suggested the kingdom will list 1% to 2% of Aramco on its local stock exchange, and then list another slice on an international exchange at a later date — with a total public sale of roughly 5% of the company. Exchanges in New York, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo have all been vying for the international listing.Saudi Aramco is the world's largest integrated oil and gas company. The company has been valued at around $2 trillion by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but Reuters cite bankers and company insiders as saying its value is closer to $1.5 trillion.Saudi Aramco's IPO has been closely-anticipated in the last few years but has been delayed amid oil price volatility, valuation uncertainty, the location of the share listing and geopolitical events such the drone and missile attack in September. The IPO could be the world's largest, and if it achieves a valuation of $1.5 trillion Saudi Aramco would far exceed the market capitalization of market giants like Apple and Microsoft.The public listing is seen as part of the crown prince's economic reform plan, known as Vision 2030.The company said one of its priorities was delivering ""sustainable and growing dividends through crude oil price cycles""; Aramco said Sunday that ""subject to the board's discretion after consideration of a number of factors, the board intends to declare aggregate ordinary cash dividends of at least $75.0 billion with respect to calendar year 2020, in addition to any potential special dividends.""Last week, Reuters reported that the company would begin trading on the Tadawul on December 11. Citing anonymous sources, Al Arabiya said pricing will start on November 17 with a final price for the float expected to be announced on December 4.Aramco noted Sunday that its crude oil production accounted for approximately one in every eight barrels of crude oil produced globally from 2016 to 2018. In the first six months of 2019, the company produced 13.2 million barrels per day of oil equivalent, including 10.0 million barrels per day of crude oil (including blended condensate).",pos

"(Adds detail, background) Maher ChmaytelliDUBAI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Saudi state oil giant Aramco will sell 0.5% of its shares to individual retail investors and the government will have a lockup period of a year on further share sales after the initial public offering, its prospectus said on Saturday.The more than 600-page prospectus did not include details of how much of the company would be floated in total or of any commitments from anchor investors.Sources have said the company could sell 1%-2% on the Saudi stock market in what could be the world's largest listing.Aramco fired the starting gun on the initial public offering (IPO) on Nov. 3 after a series of false starts. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries.Among the risks highlighted in the prospectus were the potential for terrorist attacks and the potential for encountering anti-trust legislation, as well as the right of the Saudi government to decide maximum crude output and direct Aramco to undertake projects outside its core business.Aramco may also change its dividend policy without prior notice to its minority shareholders, it said.Aramco's oil facilities were targeted on Sept. 14 in unprecedented attacks that temporarily shut 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of output - more than 5% of global oil supply.LOCKUP PERIODThe prospectus said the government will have a ""statutory lockup period"" for disposing of any shares after the listing for six months, and a contractual lockup period for twelve months.Aramco cannot list additional shares for a period of six months after trading starts, and will also be restricted from issuing additional shares for twelve months.Bankers have told the Saudi government that investors will likely value the company at around $1.5 trillion, below the $2 trillion valuation touted by Prince Mohammed when he first floated the idea of an IPO nearly four years ago.Initial hopes for a 5% IPO on domestic and international bourses were dashed last year when the process was halted amid debate over where to list Aramco overseas.Aramco said the timetable was delayed because it began a process to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp.The prospectus said Goldman Sachs was named as stabilising agent for the deal.Analysts from banks working on the Riyadh bourse have projected a wide valuation range between $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion.At the top valuation of $2 billion, Aramco could potentially raise $40 billion, topping the record-breaking $25 billion raised by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.The valuation would be almost twice that of Microsoft , currently the world's most valuable listed company, and seven times that of Exxon Mobil Corp, the biggest listed oil major by market capitalisation.

"Saudi Aramco will sell up to 0.5% of its shares to individual investors in what could be the largest initial public offering in history.The world's biggest oil company released a prospectus Saturday, providing further information but without revealing the precise size of its planned share offering.Saudi Aramco said the process begins Nov. 17 and closes Dec. 4. A final offer price, as well as the number and percentage of company shares that will be sold, will be determined at the end of that period.The prospectus says individual investors will have until Nov. 28 to request shares, noting that ""up to 0.5%"" of the company's shares will be allocated to individual investors.Saudi Aramco confirmed plans to pay annual, aggregate cash dividends of at least $75 billion starting in calendar year 2020, in addition to any special dividends.However, investors can't yet gauge the value of those dividends' yield relative to other companies until they can clearly assess the valuation of Saudi Aramco and its shares. Dividend investors are attracted to steady returns, and they try to put their money into stocks with the best yields.Exxon Mobil shares have a dividend yield of 4.92%, based on their Friday closing price of $70.77 per share. Chevron's yield stands at 3.94%, and BP comes in at 6.28%.The Saudi government will face a lockup period of six months on further sales of shares after Aramco's public offering. The IPO is being underwritten by J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, among others.Aramco said last week that it plans to float its shares on the Saudi Stock Exchange — known as the Tadawul — in December.Analysts' valuations of the company have varied from $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion. In comparison, Aramco's closest U.S. rival, Exxon Mobil, has a market cap of nearly $300 billion and Chevron is valued at about $229 billion.The much-anticipated IPO was first flagged in 2016 by the government of Saudi Arabia, and has faced multiple delays, reportedly amid concerns its finances would be publicly scrutinized. Drone attacks on its key oil facilities in September also raised worries about security and threatened to jeopardize its planned listing.Aramco warned that terrorism and armed conflict could materially impact the market price of its shares.Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC last week that the company's public debut will help diversify the kingdom's economy. The move could also strengthen Saudi Arabia's stock exchange by drawing domestic and international investment.There have been reports Aramco may undertake a dual listing. Its chairman, Yasir al-Rumayyan, said at a news conference last week that the international listing would be decided on ""going forward.""Some predicted that between 1% and 2% of the company will be listed domestically, and another part listed on a major international exchange later. Stock exchanges from New York and London to Hong Kong and Tokyo have all been vying for Aramco's international debut. The prospectus released Saturday did not address any of these issuesThe public listing of Aramco — officially known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. — is part of the ""Saudi Vision 2030,"" an economic reform plan spearheaded by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The young ruler has ambitious plans to steer the kingdom's economy away from its heavy reliance on oil, and develop non-oil sectors like tourism, health care and mining.Saudi Arabia has huge oil reserves of more than 260 billion barrels. The kingdom is one of the top producers and exporters of petroleum globally, and owns some 18% of the world's proven petroleum reserves. The oil and gas sector comprises half the country's gross domestic product and some 70% of its export earnings.",pos
"Saudi Aramco may have finally fired the starting pistol on its initial public offering (IPO), but some analysts still believe investors should think carefully before jumping on board.The company, the most profitable in the world, announced Sunday that it's planning to list on its local stock market, the Tadawul, in December.But a lack of details on the listing, which eventually could be the largest on record, has left some analysts cold. And they believe there are plenty of reasons why international investors should be wary.Aramco said Sunday that ""the final offer price, number of shares to be sold and percentage of the shares to be sold will be determined at the end of the book-building period."" The company's IPO prospectus will be released on November 9.As such, analysts were left speculating on the finer details of the offering, and these could make all the difference to investor interest, they said.""Yes, it's (the IPO has) been confirmed but at this point in time they haven't really given us a set timetable as to when the transaction is going to get under way or complete,"" David Lennox, resources analyst at Fat Prophets, told CNBC Monday.Previous reports have suggested the kingdom will list 1% to 2% of Aramco on its local stock exchange, and then list another slice on an international exchange at a later date — with a total public sale of roughly 5% of the company. Exchanges in New York, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo have all been vying for the international listing.Lennox said the valuation could make all the difference to investors. ""We've also not seen any form of valuation, (although) we've seen quite wide numbers from $1 trillion to $2 trillion. We think it's about $1.4 trillion so you can take your pick,"" he said.""The other factor we don't know at the moment is just how much of it are they going to float? … So there are a lot of questions we've yet to really have answered before one can say we're going to see this IPO go ahead,"" he said.The IPO has been closely-anticipated in the last few years but has been delayed amid oil price volatility, valuation uncertainty, the location of the share listing and geopolitical events such the drone and missile attack in September.The public listing could be the world's largest, and if it achieves a valuation of $1.5 trillion Saudi Aramco would far exceed the market capitalization of giants like Apple and Microsoft.The company said one of its priorities was delivering ""sustainable and growing dividends through crude oil price cycles"" and that ""subject to the board's discretion after consideration of a number of factors, the board intends to declare aggregate ordinary cash dividends of at least $75.0 billion with respect to calendar year 2020, in addition to any potential special dividends.""How far that dividend goes will be subject to the amount of shares the company decides to list. ""We've got the dividend amount but we just don't know the amount of shares,"" Lennox said, noting that ""if they issue a bucket load of shares then that dividend amount is not going to go far.""Meanwhile, analysts at Bernstein noted that it was hard to evaluate a company like Aramco, which it likened to a ""monster oil"" company.They cite the fact that Saudi Aramco is the most profitable company in the world — in 2018 its net income was $111 billion, five times bigger than Exxon or Shell. The analysts also note it has an oil reserve life of 52 years and its reserves are the cheapest to extract.""What's fair value for a company with access to 201 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, produces 1 in every 8 global oil barrels, is instrumental in supporting oil prices and owns the world's 4th largest integrated Downstream system pointing at Asia? While we're used to valuing Big Oil, Aramco is Monster Oil, so this is literally the trillion-dollar question,"" Bernstein Senior Analysts Oswald Clint and Neil Beveridge said in a note Monday.Geopolitical factors, like Saudi Arabia's tense relationship with regional rival Iran, could also dampen investor sentiment.""If you look at it from the perspective of international investors, there are obviously concerns,"" Bob Parker, investment committee member at Quilvest Wealth Management, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" Monday.""Do you want to invest in a region where the relationship with Iran is fraught?,"" he asked. ""We've also had infrastructure risk related to (the drone and missile attack) a few months ago and a large part of Saudi Aramco infrastructure being damaged.""In addition, Parker said the valuation might also be a factor adding to international investors' concerns.""International investors might say well perhaps I need a discount to warrant my investment in Saudi Aramco … But that discount doesn't seem to be there,"" he said. Parker added that he also believed oil prices were going to be subject to downward pressure.""All of those factors I think means that this is going to be a difficult IPO,"" he warned.Oil prices slumped in mid-2014 amid a glut in global supply and lackluster demand. Prices fell dramatically and major global oil producers like Saudi Arabia, and other OPEC producers decided to cut back on production to help stabilize supply and demand, and prices.U.S. shale producers have not cut back production meanwhile, and there are still concerns over supply dynamics and demand, particularly amid an ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China that has dampened global growth. On Monday, oil prices were trading at $62.22 per barrel for Brent crude and $56.62 for West Texas Intermediate (WTI). Both were comfortably over $100 a barrel around five years ago.Analysts like Fat Prophets' David Lennox feel that the IPO could be coming too late; ""We think this IPO is probably several years too late. You've now got in the U.S. a well-established competitor producing 12 million barrels of oil a day whereas several years ago that wasn't even around,"" Lennox said.""There's a lot of questions that we'll have to sit down and look at,"" he added.",neg
"(Adds comment from Singapore exchange)DUBAI/RIYADH, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco aims to announce the start of its initial public offering (IPO) on Nov. 3, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, after delaying the deal earlier this month to give advisers time to secure cornerstone investors.The people also said Aramco’s chief executive officer, Amin Nasser, was not present at the conference on Tuesday as he was meeting investors abroad ahead of the offering.Aramco is looking to float a 1% to 2% stake on the kingdoms Tadawul market, in what would be one of the largest ever public offerings, worth upwards of $20 billion.Aramco, in response to queries by Reuters, said on Tuesday the oil company “does not comment on rumour or speculation. The company continues to engage with the shareholders on IPO readiness activities. The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholders’ choosing.”The people declined to be identified due to commercial sensitivities.The company will soon have more shareholders from institutions, the head of the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, Yassir al-Rumayyan, said.Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and chairman of Aramco’s board of directors, was speaking at a panel at the conference in Riyadh.Aramco will start subscription for investors in its initial public offering on Dec. 4, Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya said in a news flash on Tuesday citing sources.The oil giant plans to announce the transaction’s price on Nov. 17, it added. The company will begin trading on the local stock market, the Tadawul, on Dec. 11, the broadcaster reported.The prospect of Aramco selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first flagged it three years ago.However, his desired $2 trillion valuation has always been questioned by some financiers and industry experts, who note that countries have been accelerating efforts to shift away from fossil fuels to curb global warming, putting oil prices under pressure and undermining producers equity value.Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), is working on a consortium of investors for Aramco’s IPO, its chief executive said.There are several Russian pensions funds who are interested to invest in the Aramco IPO and we have also received indications from our Russia-China fund of some Chinese major institutions also interested in Aramco IPO,” Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) head Kirill Dmitriev told reporters on Tuesday.Separately, Aramco has not approached the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) to invest in the IPO, the sovereign wealth fund’s managing director Farouk Bastaki said on Tuesday.“KIA has not been approached by Aramco or its advisers for the IPO, and KIA will look at the IPO like any other investment,” Bastaki told reporters on the sidelines of an investment conference in Riyadh.Singapore Exchange Limited’s chief executive Boon Chye Loh on Tuesday declined to comment directly on whether the exchange was in talks about a future international listing of Aramco in Singapore.“As an exchange that offers efficient access into almost 100% of Asia, we are as attractive as any other exchange for any other company looking for capital raising,” he said on the sidelines of the conference in Riyadh.(Reporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh in Dubai, Davide Barbuscia and Saeed Azhar in Riyadh; Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal and Marwa Rashad in Riyadh, and Asma AlSharif in Dubai; editing by Giles Elgood and Jason Neely)",pos
"(Adds comment)DUBAI, Nov 3 (Reuters) - State energy company Saudi Aramco kick-started its initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday, announcing its intention to list on the domestic bourse as the kingdom seeks to diversify and create the world's most valuable listed company.SALAH SHAMMA, HEAD OF INVESTMENT MENA, FRANKLIN TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS EQUITY""With Aramco likely to list 5% of the company over time (1% locally and 4% on an exchange abroad) at a hypothetical $1.5 - $2 trillion valuation, the offering could add up to 1.8 percentage points to its MSCI EM Index representation. This will bring the MENA regions overall weighting close to 7%, putting it on par with the likes of Emerging Europe, Brazil, South Africa and India, a significant milestone in the evolution of MENA capital markets.""It is a colossal public offering that could potentially generate more than 10 years worth of proceeds raised through IPOs in the country.""Some local investors could be selling other shares in order to shift their investments to Aramco and we have seen some ripple effects with the Tadawul All Share Index losing more than 20% from a recent high in early May. In our view, however, this could well be a case of short-term pain for long-term gain.""RORY FYFE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MENA ADVISORS""Aramco will have to offer a dividend yield of more than the international oil majors as it is not necessarily a profit maximiser and is more heavily swayed by national development and political objectives than other oil majors.""Investor rule of law over Aramco is also weaker. A $75 billion dividend would therefore imply a valuation of well below $1.5 trillion, let alone $2 trillion.""Whatever this local round achieves, with domestic players being strong armed into investing, international investors are still going to value this well below the expectations of (Crown Prince) Mohammed bin Salman.""MONICA MALIK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ABU DHABI COMMERCIAL BANK""The part-IPO is a cornerstone of Saudi Arabias transformation plan and a listing will be a high profile symbol of progress with the reform programme. From an economic perspective, it will provide funds to progress with the key megaprojects that are central to the transformation plan, though the amount raised if 1-2% is listed is unlikely to make a significant dent in the capital requirement. The critical questions still remains the amount to be listed and the valuation.""GARY ROSS, CEO, BLACK GOLD INVESTORS""This is the most important economic event in Saudi Arabia in decades. The beginning of a new era which will reinvigorate a sluggish economy overly dependent on oil. The pathway for economic development is now clear but will KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) make the right investments to energise growth and provide jobs for a young, growing labour force whose patience is not unlimited? Selling a small piece of Aramco in a captive market gives the KSA more control to prop the value of Aramco up over its fair value.""HASNAIN MALIK, HEAD OF EQUITY STRATEGY, TELLIMER""The dividend announcement is in line with previous statements.""Some perspective on the Aramco IPO for the overall Saudi diversification story is needed. The likely Aramco IPO proceeds will be less than the Aramco dividends the government received in the first half of 2019 alone.""ANITA YADAV, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CENTURY FINANCIAL""According to publicly available information, the Kingdom is targeting a valuation of $2 trillion for Aramco. Last year the company made profits of $111 billion and it is planning to pay dividends of $75 billion next year. The valuation looks stretched at 18 times earnings and with an expected dividend yield of 3.75%.""A quick study of the energy companies with a market capitalisation higher than $100 billion will show that the median PE (price to earnings ratio) as well as dividend yield are 16.44 and 4.8% respectively. From that aspect, a valuation of $1.5 trillion to $1.8 trillion seems justified.""AMRITA SEN, CO-FOUNDER, ENERGY ASPECTS""We believe the IPO won't change Saudi Arabia's OPEC policy.

"Saudi Arabia's state oil giant could be valued at up to $1.7 trillion, according to a price range announced Sunday for its upcoming listing, less than the $2 trillion figure the kingdom's crown prince had previously targeted.Saudi Aramco said in a press statement Sunday morning that it's hoping to sell a 1.5% stake in the company, or about 3 billion shares. The indicative price range for the shares is 30 Saudi riyals ($8.00) to 32 riyals, valuing the initial public offering (IPO) up to as much as 96 billion riyals ($25.60 billion) — at the top end of the range, according to Reuters.The figure implies that the oil giant is worth between $1.6 trillion to $1.7 trillion. The IPO next month could beat the record $25 billion raised by China's e-commerce firm Alibaba when it debuted in New York in 2014.Aramco's listing is due in December and the company said last weekend that it will sell up to 0.5% of its shares to individual investors. Speculation and delayed announcements on the public listing of the world's most profitable company have riveted investors and market watchers since plans for the float were first disclosed three years ago.The oil giant has delayed the IPO — originally scheduled for 2018 — multiple times, reportedly over Saudi concerns about public scrutiny over its finances and because of the complexity of its corporate structure.Analysts' valuations of the company have varied from $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion. In comparison, Aramco's closest U.S. rival, Exxon Mobil, has a market cap of nearly $300 billion and Chevron is valued at about $229 billion. When the IPO was first flagged in 2016 by the now-Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he said then that he believed the company was worth around $2 trillion.The Aramco listing would aim to drum up cash for a government looking to significantly reduce its budget deficit and diversify its economy beyond oil as part of the crown prince's Vision 2030 program.The country's economy is still largely reliant on oil exports. Lackluster oil prices (a barrel of Brent crude is currently priced near $63) have prompted the country's budget deficit (the amount by which its spending exceeds its revenues) to widen.In 2018, the budget deficit was forecast at around 136 billion riyals (or around $36 billion), according to the kingdom's Ministry of Finance. It's expected to be a similar amount in 2019. And in 2020, the kingdom expects the deficit to widen to $50 billion, the kingdom's finance minister said in October, according to Reuters.Zachary Cefaratti, CEO of Saudi fund manager Dalma Capital, told CNBC Sunday that the preliminary valuation was in line with his company's expectations and it was planning to subscribe to the IPO in two funds it managed.""Aramco will have a sizable weight of nearly 10% in the Saudi local market index based the current price range and stake, and Saudi Arabia's weight in the MSCI Emerging Markets index will also increase as a result,"" he said, adding that it was a ""positive step"" toward Saudi Arabia diversifying its economy. —CNBC's Natasha Turak, Emma Graham, Holly Ellyatt and Joanna Tan contributed to this article.",pos

"Saudi Arabia, Russia and their oil-producing allies are considering a range of options to maintain stability in the oil market just weeks ahead of a critical December meeting.The so-called OPEC+ group struck another deal late last year to cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to support prices. The agreement runs until March 2020, and the producers are due to meet in Vienna to review the terms of the policy on December 5-6.""The house view is that the meeting is likely to reaffirm the group's commitments to the cut that is already in place,"" Peter Lee, senior oil and gas analyst at Fitch Solutions, told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" Thursday.""The current deal will remain in place until the end of Q1 (the first quarter) next year, and we see scope for the deal to be extended until the end of next year,"" Lee added.Analysts believe that OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia is likely pressuring laggard members, such as Iraq and Nigeria, to improve their own compliance in order to bolster crude prices ahead of the long-awaited Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO).""According to delegates across the group, they will be pushing for better adherence to the current production cut agreement,"" analysts at ANZ Bank said in a research note on Thursday.But the need for deeper production cuts remains uncertain, given the slew of major events leading up to the December 5-6 Vienna meetings that could complicate the decision-making process.On December 3-4, President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping may come face-to-face at the NATO Heads of State and Government meeting in London. While the meeting and the location are not yet confirmed, a resolution to the trade war may prove to be a catalyst for oil prices and likely reduce the need for OPEC+ to act.Meanwhile, Aramco is reportedly planning to release its IPO pricing on December 4 — just one day ahead of the Vienna meetings. Clarity on the pricing could also influence the producer group's decisions.""It makes sense for people to argue that because of the IPO and other reasons, they will push for deeper cuts. I'm not buying into that straight away,"" Vandana Hari, founder of Vanda Insights, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""""Russia has become far more dovish, and we've seen that clearly since the end of last year. If prices remain supported around current levels and there is no danger of them continuing to tumble below, I think overall especially with regards to Russia, the argument will be far more difficult for the Saudis to make for deeper cuts,"" she added.Others analysts disagree.""There appears (to be) an increasing likelihood that Saudi Arabia, along with other core OPEC+ members, the UAE, Kuwait and Iraq, might need to contemplate deepening the magnitude of cuts in the upcoming OPEC+ meeting in Vienna between 5-6 December, even if Russia refrains from cooperating,"" said Ehsan Khoman, head of MENA research and strategy at MUFG.Saudi Arabia, a major producer and de facto leader of OPEC, has considerable influence within the producer group. It may also consider shouldering more of the production cuts alone, analysts believe.""Saudi certainly has the will and capability within its scope to lower production if need be,"" Lee said.""It remains to be seen how far Saudi Arabia is willing to go in terms of supporting the market, but as things stand right now, we are not factoring in a deeper OPEC cut that will be coming into play next year,"" Lee said.Despite the success of the multi-country agreement, sentiment in the oil market has remained weak.

"year@* Riyadh to sell 2% of Aramco in domestic IPO - sources* Final pricing due Dec. 5, market debut Dec. 11 - sources* Govt faces one-year curb on selling more shares - sources* Restriction means any overseas listing unlikely in 2020* GRAPHIC-Aramco valuations: https://tmsnrt.rs/34ubrpj (Adds Aramco no comment)DUBAI/RIYADH, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The Saudi government plans to sell 2% of state oil giant Aramco in a domestic listing on Dec. 11, three sources familiar with the matter said, but restrictions on future share sales mean an international IPO is ruled out for at least a year.Final pricing for the IPO (initial public offering) is scheduled for Dec. 5 and the world’s most profitable company is expected to start trading on the Riyadh bourse six days later, the sources said.The Saudi government will face a one-year restriction on selling more Aramco shares following the domestic listing, according to the sources, meaning any overseas IPO is unlikely to be held in 2020.Saudi Aramco declined to comment while the Saudi government’s media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Aramco fired the starting gun on the domestic IPO on Sunday after a series of false starts. However it did not give details on how much of the company would be sold, or when the listing would happen, while expert valuations of the company vary wildly from around $1.2 to $2.3 trillion.Sunday’s announcement had said Aramco and the selling shareholder would be subject to restrictions on the sale, disposition or issuance of additional shares, but did not provide the lock-up period. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries.Initial hopes for a 5% initial public offering (IPO) on domestic and international bourses were dashed last year when the process was halted amid debate over where to list Aramco overseas.Aramco said the IPO timetable was delayed because it began a process to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp.ON THE ROADAramco roadshows for the Riyadh IPO will begin on Nov. 18, according to the sources.Bankers have told the Saudi government that investors will likely value the company at around $1.5 trillion, below the $2 trillion valuation touted by Prince Mohammed when he first floated the idea of an IPO nearly four years ago.Sources had told Reuters earlier the oil company could offer 1%-2% of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion.A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking one of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.A $2 trillion valuation would be almost twice that of Microsoft, currently the world’s most valuable listed company and seven times that of Exxon Mobil Corp, the biggest listed oil major by market cap.The Saudi government is looking to list 2% of the company on the Saudi bourse though, rather than listing the entire share capital on the exchange, the sources said.Normally public companies list the entire share capital on the exchange and have a portion of that as free float.“Aramco would become the largest company by market cap in the MSCI EM index following listing but would account for only 0.5-0.6% of the index given an expected low index weighting,” Bernstein analysts said in a note on Tuesday.(Reporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh and Marwa Rashad; Additional reporting by Ron Bousso; Writing by Saeed Azhar; Editing by David Evans and Pravin Char)",pos

"year@ (Adds detail, background)DUBAI/RIYADH, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The Saudi government plans to sell 2% of state oil giant Aramco in a domestic listing on Dec. 11, three sources familiar with the matter said, but restrictions on future share sales mean an international IPO is ruled out for at least a year.Final pricing for the IPO (initial public offering) is scheduled for Dec. 5 and the world’s most profitable company is expected to start trading on the Riyadh bourse six days later, the sources said.The Saudi government will face a one-year restriction on selling more Aramco shares following the domestic listing, according to the sources, meaning any overseas IPO is unlikely to be held in 2020.Aramco fired the starting gun on the domestic IPO on Sunday. However it did not give details on how much of the company would be sold, or when the listing would happen, while expert valuations of the company vary wildly from around $1.2 to $2.3 trillion.Sunday’s announcement had said Aramco and the selling shareholder would be subject to restrictions on the sale, disposition or issuance of additional shares, but did not provide the lock-up period. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to raise billions of dollars in the listing to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries.Initial hopes for a 5% initial public offering (IPO) in the domestic and international bourses were dashed last year when the process was halted amid debate over where to list Aramco overseas.Aramco said the IPO timetable was delayed because it began a process to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp.Aramco roadshows will begin on Nov. 18, according to the sources.Bankers have told the Saudi government that investors will likely value the company at around $1.5 trillion, below the $2 trillion valuation touted by Prince Mohammed when he first floated the idea of an IPO nearly four years ago.Sources had told Reuters earlier the oil company could offer 1%-2% of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion.A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking one of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.(Reporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh and Marwa Rashad; Writing by Saeed Azhar; Editing by David Evans and Pravin Char)",pos
"Saudi Arabia kick-started Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday as its market regulator approved the oil giant’s application to list on the domestic bourse and create the world’s most valuable listed firm. A statement from the Capital Market Authority (CMA) did not give a time frame or say how much Aramco would sell, but sources have told Reuters the oil company could offer 1% to 2% of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much $20 billion to $40 billion. Confirmation of the share sale in Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Aramco, as the oil giant is usually known, comes about seven weeks after crippling attacks on its oil facilities, underlining Saudi Arabia’s determination to push on with the listing regardless. The IPO of the world’s most profitable company is designed to turbo charge Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s economic reform agenda by raising billions to diversify the kingdom, whose dependency on oil was highlighted by the production impact of the Sept. 14 attacks. The CMA said its board “has issued its resolution approving the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) ... application for the registration and offering of part of its shares.” The authority said approval would remain valid for six months. Saudi Aramco will release the IPO prospectus on Nov. 10, Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya said on Sunday, citing sources. The listing announcement had been expected on Oct. 20 but was delayed after advisers said they needed more time to lock in cornerstone investors, three sources told Reuters. To help get the deal done, Saudi Arabia is relying on easy credit for retail investors and hefty contributions from rich locals. Prince Mohammed gave the green light on Friday for the IPO to go ahead, Reuters reported, citing sources. Although he put a $2 trillion valuation on the company in early 2016, bankers and company insiders say Aramco’s value is closer to $1.5 trillion. A growing movement to fight climate change and embrace new “green” technologies have put some fund managers, particularly in Europe and the United States, off the oil and gas sector. At a valuation of $1.5 trillion, Aramco would still be worth at least 50% more than the world’s most valuable companies, Microsoft and Apple, which each have a market capitalization of about $1 trillion. But a 1% sale would ‘only’ raise around $15 billion for Saudi coffers, less than the $25 billion generated by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in its record-breaking IPO in 2014. It would rank Aramco as the 11th biggest IPO of all time, Refinitiv data show.  A sale of 2% of Aramco shares at a $1.5 trillion valuation would make it the biggest IPO of all time, beating Alibaba’s. The prospect of the world’s largest oil company selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Prince Mohammed flagged it three years ago. Initial hopes for a blockbuster international listing of about 5% were dashed when the share sale was halted last year amid debate over where to list Aramco overseas. Aramco said the IPO timetable was delayed because it began a process to acquire a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries. IPO preparations were revived over the summer after Aramco attracted huge interest in its first international bond sale, seen as a pre-IPO relationship-building exercise with investors. The bond sale forced the secretive company to reveal its finances for the first time, including net income of $111 billion, over a third bigger than the combined net income of the five super majors Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron, and Total. Oil majors have been raising payouts to shareholders to counter rising pressure from climate activism. Aramco has said it will pay a base dividend of $75 billion, which at a valuation of $1.5 trillion would mean a dividend yield of 5%, below those offered by competitors such as Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell. Shell’s dividend yield is over 6% and Exxon’s over 5%, according to Refinitiv data.  The September attacks on Aramco’s largest oil plant, which shut off about 5% of global supply, raised questions about the vulnerability of Aramco’s oil fields, plants and exports amid deepening regional tensions. In its April bond prospectus, Aramco noted that any disruption to its processing facilities could harm its business. The potential threat to the company’s valuation presents a challenge for Yasser al-Rumayyan, head of the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, who became Aramco chairman in September. Al-Rumayyan replaced former energy minister Khalid al-Falih in a move to separate Aramco from the ministry ahead of an IPO. Aramco hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead the IPO, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank. It added a number of banks as bookrunners.Saudi Aramco said it posted a net income of $68 billion during the nine-month period ending on September 30.The company’s revenues and other income related to sales for the same period amounted to $244 billion, it said.Aramco also said Saudi nationals subscribing to the listing will be eligible to receive bonus shares.",pos
"* Aramco could sell 1%-2% on Saudi bourse-sources* It plans to create the world’s most valuable company* IPO aimed at diversifying economy away from oil (Adds details on security, fund manager quote) RashadDUBAI/DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s state oil company kick-started its initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday, announcing its intention to list on the domestic bourse as the kingdom seeks to diversify and create the world’s most valuable listed company.Aramco did not give a time frame or say how much of the company it would sell, but sources have told Reuters the oil company could offer 1%-2% of its shares on the local bourse, raising as much as $20 billion-$40 billion.Aramco said the IPO would be split into two tranches: one each for institutional and individual investors. The percentage of shares to be sold and the purchase price would be determined after the book-building period, it added in a statement.Confirmation of the share sale in Saudi Arabian Oil Co, or Aramco, as the oil giant is usually known, comes about seven weeks after crippling attacks on its oil facilities, underlining Saudi Arabia’s determination to push on with the listing regardless.Aramco said it does not expect the Sept. 14 attack on its oil plants will have a material impact on its business, operations and financial condition. The attacks targeted the Abqaiq and Khurais plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry, causing fires and damage and temporarily shutting down 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production - more than 5% of global oil supply.The company did not specific any additional security measures.The IPO of the world’s most profitable company is designed to turbocharge Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s economic reform agenda by raising billions to diversify the kingdom, whose dependency on oil was highlighted by the production impact of the September attacks.“It is a colossal public offering that could potentially generate more than 10 years worth of proceeds raised through IPOs in the country,” said Salah Shamma, head of investment, MENA, Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity.He said some local investors could be selling other shares in order to shift their investments to Aramco, but this could well be a case of “short-term pain for long-term gain.”LONG-AWAITED IPOAramco plans to release the IPO prospectus on Nov. 9, Chief Executive Amin Nasser told a news conference in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.Saudi Aramco chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan told the news conference that the valuation for the company should be determined after the roadshow.At a valuation of $1.5 trillion, Aramco would still be worth at least 50% more than the world’s most valuable companies, Microsoft and Apple, which each have a market capitalisation of about $1 trillion.But a 1% sale would raise “only” around $15 billion for Saudi coffers, less than the $25 billion generated by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in its record-breaking IPO in 2014.It would rank Aramco as the 11th biggest IPO of all time, Refinitiv data show.

"IPO@ (Recasts with Saudi Aramco’s statement)SINGAPORE, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco, the world’s top oil exporter, has appointed its first woman head of an overseas office, the company said late on Wednesday.Marwa al-Khuzaim will helm Aramco Asia Singapore as managing director from Dec. 1, overseeing the company’s corporate strategies in southeast Asia and Australia, taking over from Nader al-Arfaj, Aramco said in a statement.Al-Khuzaim will be responsible for the marketing of crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and oil products, and drive the performance of services such as supply chain, procurement and inspection in Singapore, Aramco said.Al-Khuzaim was previously a supply chain director at Aramco Chemicals Company, a unit of Aramco, the company said.Her appointment comes before the world’s most profitable company starts a share sale on Nov. 17 in an initial public offering (IPO) that may raise between $20 billion and $40 billion.

"The initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco will provide the oil-rich kingdom with an answer to Apple in the U.S., according to the head of EMEA oil and gas research at J.P. Morgan.Saudi Aramco announced plans to go public on Sunday, with the state-owned oil behemoth poised to determine its final launch price over the coming weeks.In what could constitute the biggest stock market listing in history, the Aramco IPO is designed to turbocharge Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans to diversify the economy beyond oil.When asked why Saudi Arabia needed to list Aramco in order to help facilitate an energy transition, J.P. Morgan’s Christyan Malek replied: “Remember Vision 2030 and this national transformation plan — the crux of this was to basically transform the kingdom to get investment.”“Basically, the U.S. has Apple, Saudi has Aramco,” he added.At the start of October, Apple surpassed Microsoft in market capitalization to retake the title as the world’s most valuable company.However, if Saudi Aramco, the most profitable company in the world, achieves a valuation of $1.5 trillion next month, it will far exceed the market capitalization of the California-based tech behemoth.On Sunday, Saudi Aramco said it is planning to list on its local stock market, the Tadawul, in December.Speaking to CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Tuesday, Malek urged energy market participants to think about what the Aramco IPO will mean in terms of the OPEC kingpin’s attempt to attract foreign direct investment (FDI).“There is a sort of halo effect which I think is understated to some extent in the context of what they are trying to do as part of these long-term plans.”“Remember, diversification of oil means other industries also expanding away from oil, whether its refining, manufacturing (or) financial services,” Malek said.Aramco has reportedly recruited nine banks as joint global co-ordinators to lead the stock market listing, including J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial bank.“The kingdom is looking at this as a way to deliver the non-oil side to effectively diversify. It is so important for the kingdom to basically raise profile, get FDI into the country and arguably this IPO is one of those conduits,” Malek said.“So, in theory, the appetite is very much linked to the kingdom’s view that they want to open up the country.”Aramco has said its IPO prospectus will be released on November 9.The starting gun of Aramco’s stock market listing has been eagerly-anticipated in recent years, despite repeated delays amid oil price volatility, valuation uncertainty, the location of share listing and geopolitical events — such as the drone and missile attack in September.“We believe that the Aramco IPO will be an industry-defining event,” analysts at Bernstein said in a research note published Monday.Oswald Clint and Neil Beveridge, both senior analysts at Bernstein, said in the note that investors would be interested in a “monster oil” company like Aramco because of its scale, profitability and shareholder dividends.They cite the fact that Aramco is the most profitable business in the world, with an oil reserve life of 52 years. Further to this, Aramco’s oil reserves are the cheapest to extract.“But, there are also risks and Aramco will clearly not be for every investor.”“Recent attacks at Abqaiq have highlighted a potential vulnerability to geopolitical risk. Fiscal stability and alignment with government cannot be assumed indefinitely. Most importantly, policies which seek to limit carbon may negatively impact long-term oil demand and pricing,” analysts at Bernstein said.— CNBC’s Holly Ellyatt contributed to this report.",pos
"DUBAI — Saudi state-owned oil giant Aramco is planning to announce the start of its long-anticipated public offering on Sunday November 3, Reuters reported Tuesday, citing three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.State broadcaster Al Arabiya reported that shares of the company will begin trading on the Tadawul, Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange, on December 11. The local outlet also said Aramco aims to announce the transaction price on November 17 with a final IPO price announcement planned for December 4.In a comment to CNBC, Aramco said it “does not comment on rumor or speculation. The company continues to engage with the shareholders on IPO readiness activities. The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholders’ choosing.”The reports come as the kingdom kicks off its Future Investment Initiative (FII), an annual showcase of its investment opportunities, attended by major international investors and state officials.Speculation and delayed announcements on the public listing of the world’s largest company have riveted investors and market watchers since plans for the float were first disclosed three years ago. The oil giant has delayed the IPO — originally scheduled for 2018 — multiple times, reportedly over Saudi concerns about public scrutiny over its finances and because of the complexity of its corporate structure. The listing would be the largest public offering in history.The kingdom reportedly plans to list 1% of Aramco on its local stock exchange before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020, as first steps ahead of a public sale of roughly 5% of the company.Speaking at the FII on Tuesday, Saudi Public Investment Fund Governor Yasir al-Rumayyan said that the prior separation of Aramco from the kingdom’s sprawling energy ministry was to avoid a conflict of interest, and told attendees that Aramco will have more institutional shareholders “soon.”The Aramco listing would aim to drum up cash for a government looking to significantly reduce its budget deficit and diversify its economy beyond oil as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030.—CNBC’s Emma Graham contributed to this article.",pos
"The public listing of Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company has been highly anticipated by the market, but analysts say investors should consider the influence the kingdom has over the company.“The biggest issue with Aramco is that everything about this company is controlled by the Saudi royal family — shareholder opinions, your board votes, none of that makes any difference,” said Pavel Molchanov, director and energy analyst at Raymond James.Responding to CNBC’s queries about such concerns, Saudi Aramco referred to its prospectus which outlined its  corporate governance policies, as well as the relationship between the oil company and Saudi Arabia. On its website, Aramco also said it has a “rule-based relationship with the government” and a history of “operating independently.”Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, announced Saturday that up to 0.5% of its shares will be allocated for individual investors in its initial public offering. The IPO is set for December on Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul exchange.The 658-page preliminary prospectus divulged operational information about Saudi Aramco, but didn’t list a possible price range for the shares or give a definite idea how many shares will be offered.Analysts’ valuations of the company range widely, between $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman put a $2 trillion valuation on the oil firm when he first touted the idea of a listing in 2016.Even within the lower range of that valuation, Aramco could become the largest stock listing in history, surpassing Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba’s $25 billion flotation in 2014, which still stands as the biggest IPO ever.But according to Molchanov, the IPO “may be too small to really be interesting” for many asset managers.“The government will do whatever it wants, whether it’s raising production, curtailing production, investing in one geography versus another,” he told CNBC on Monday. “They simply will not care what their private shareholders will wish to see.”Investors will have to consider the “political influence” of the kingdom, said Daniel Gerard, senior global multi-asset strategist at State Street.“There’s a lot to think about when buying Aramco,” he told CNBC last week, adding that an important issue is “how much political influence would there be over the investment decisions.”“Saudi Arabia is still probably the largest party who is able to influence the oil markets as a single entity,” said Gerard.“Even if the U.S. with shale oil is a larger producer, it’s not one entity that makes one decision,” he added.— This story has been updated to reflect Saudi Aramco’s response to CNBC’s queries about governance concerns.",pos

"As Saudi Aramco prepares for its long-awaited initial public offering this year, the world’s largest oil company has detailed the vast number of risks its business faces in its prospectus released over the weekend.Owned and operated by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the oil giant’s IPO is expected to be the largest in history. But, while Aramco is reportedly the most profitable company in the world, its oil and gas network is exposed to a wide variety of risks.“The following risks, which are identified as material, do not necessarily comprise all the risks affecting the Company or associated with an investment in the Shares,” Aramco said in the “Risk Factors” section of its prospectus.Aramco faces a few obvious risks – such as the supply, demand and price of crude oil or how much oil the Saudi government decides to produce, as the country is a member of the oil cartel OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries).Saudi’s oil production was also recently hit by drone attacks, which forced Riyadh to cut production by 50%. It took weeks for the Saudi government to restore capacity.Aramco sees many other risks as well, ranging from climate change to the company’s dependence on demand from Asia. Here are a few of those risks.“The impact of climate change on the demand for, and price of, hydrocarbons ... Climate change concerns and impacts could reduce global demand for hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products and could cause the Company to incur costs or invest additional capital ... Climate change concerns manifested in public sentiment, government policies, laws and regulations, international agreements and treaties and other actions may reduce global demand for hydrocarbons and propel a shift to lower carbon intensity fossil fuels such as gas or alternative energy sources ... Existing and future climate change concerns and impacts, including physical impacts to infrastructure, and related laws, regulations, treaties, protocols, policies and other actions could shift demand.”“Furthermore, the majority of the Company’s assets are located in the Kingdom and it relies heavily on a crosscountry pipeline system and terminal facilities to transport crude oil and products through the Kingdom. The Company also depends on critical assets to process its crude oil, such as the Abqaiq facility, which is the Company’s largest oil processing facility and processed approximately 50% of the Company’s crude oil production for the year ended 31 December 2018G. The East-West pipeline, the Shaybah NGL facility, the Abqaiq facility and the Khurais processing facility have recently been subject to attacks.”“International crude oil supply and demand and the sales price for crude oil are affected by many factors that are beyond the Company’s control, including ... the electrification of transportation, technological developments in the cost or endurance of fuel cells for electric vehicles and changes in transportation-mode preferences, including ride-sharing”“Risks related to economic and political developments in Asia ... in 2016G, 2017G and 2018G, customers in Asia, including the Company’s affiliated refineries located in Asia, purchased 69%, 71% and 71%, respectively, of the Company’s crude exports and 49%, 50% and 51% respectively, of the Company’s total crude production.”“Estimates of proved hydrocarbon reserves depend on significant interpretations, assumptions and judgments. Any significant deviation or changes in existing economic and operating conditions could affect the estimated quantity and value of the Company’s proved reserves.”“The Company is subject to operational risks common in the oil and gas industry, including: crude oil or gas spills, pipeline leaks and ruptures, storage tank leaks, and accidents involving explosions, fires, blow outs and surface cratering; power shortages or failures; mechanical or equipment failures; transportation interruptions and accidents; tropical monsoons, storms, floods and other natural disasters; and chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases.”“Risks related to sanctions and anti-bribery and anti-corruption regimes ... Violations of applicable sanctions and trade restrictions, as well as anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, could adversely affect the Company ... The Company is currently pursuing investment and joint venture opportunities in oil and gas and LNG projects located in Russia and with Russian counterparties ...There can be no assurance that the Company’s corporate governance and compliance policies (including with respect to sanctions and trade restrictions, anti-bribery and anti-corruption) will protect it from improper conduct of its employees or business partners.”“Risks related to chemicals and plastics regulations ... Increased concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics and their potential impact on the environment have resulted in more restrictive regulations and could lead to new regulations.”“The Company’s management team has limited experience managing a public company, interacting with investors and complying with the increasingly complex laws, regulations and other obligations pertaining to public companies.”“The Kingdom’s public finances are highly connected to the hydrocarbon industry.The hydrocarbon industry is the single largest contributor to the Kingdom’s economy. The oil sector accounted for 44.0% and 43.0% of the Kingdom’s real GDP in the years ended 31 December 2016G and 2017G, respectively (the most recent years for which information is available).”",neg
"value@* Uncertainty remains after Aramco announces IPO plans* Company did not disclose size or timing of listing* Valuations of oil giant range from $1.2 to $2.3 trillion* Saudi Aramco is world's most profitable company* GRAPHIC-Aramco valuations: https://tmsnrt.rs/34ubrpj* FACTBOX-Saudi Aramco: the oil colossus (Adds dividend graphic)Nov 4 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's blockbuster listing remained shrouded in mystery on Monday, a day after the company finally announced its plans, with scant details disclosed and expert valuations varying wildly from around $1.2 to $2.3 trillion.The state oil giant, the world's most profitable company, fired the starting gun on a domestic initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday after a series of false starts that had kept the investment world guessing.However potential investors, rattled by a damaging attack on Aramco's facilities in September, were not given key details usually included in ""intention to float"" notices - such as how much of the company will be sold, and when the sale will happen.Now fund managers are poring over bank research about the famously secretive company, but little certainty has been provided even by analysts from the Wall Street giants with roles in the IPO, five investment and banking sources told Reuters.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said he wants a $2 trillion valuation, seeking to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries.That valuation figure is almost twice that of Microsoft , currently the world's most valuable listed company and seven times that of Exxon Mobil Corp, the biggest listed oil major by market cap.Analysts from banks working on the Riyadh bourse listing have met Aramco's management in Dhahran over the past month to get more information on the company, but their valuations of the company still vary by around $1 trillion.Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a range of $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion while EFG Hermes says $1.55 trillion to $2.1 trillion, according to two fund managers who have seen the reports.Goldman Sachs - one of the IPO coordinators - has put the valuation between $1.6 trillion and $2.3 trillion, two separate sources said. Credit Suisse's research offers a similarly wide range, one of the fund managers said.A major factor in the broad spread is the various assumptions analysts are making for the future direction of oil prices, said a source familiar with the deal.The banks were not immediately available for comment.Sources have told Reuters that Aramco could offer 1%-2% of its shares, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion. A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking IPO of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.Aramco Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan said a decision on an international listing would be made in the future.ROADSHOWS AND RISKTwo bankers working on the deal estimated around 80% of shares would be sold to local retail and institutional investors, with about 20% likely to go to international buyers.Having a large domestic investor base is expected to make it easier to achieve a higher valuation. Three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters a government committee had been securing pre-sale commitments from wealthy Saudis, while retail investors were being offered cheap credit.Aramco did provide investors with some extra financial information on Sunday and Monday, including its nine-month earnings, which showed net income fell to $68.2 billion by the end of September 30, down from $83.1 billion a year earlier.The Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to give its full name, did not give a reason for the fall, but it likely reflects lower oil prices.In 2016, when the oil price hit 13-year lows, Aramco's net income was only $13 billion, according to a company bond prospectus this year, compared to $111 billion in 2018.Its net income for the third quarter of 2019 amounted to $21.1 billion, according to Reuters calculations.

"value@* Uncertainty remains after Aramco announces IPO plans* Company did not disclose size or timing of listing* Valuations of oil giant range from $1.2 to $2.3 trillion* Saudi Aramco is world's most profitable company* Nine-month net income fell to $68.2 bln from $83.1 bln (Adds links to graphics)Nov 4 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco's blockbuster listing remained shrouded in mystery on Monday, a day after the company finally announced its plans, with scant details disclosed and expert valuations varying wildly from around $1.2 to $2.3 trillion.The state oil giant, the world's most profitable company, fired the starting gun on a domestic initial public offering (IPO) on Sunday after a series of false starts that had kept the investment world guessing.However potential investors, already rattled by a crippling attack on Aramco's facilities in September, were not given key details usually included in such ""intention to float notices"" - such as how much of the company will be sold, and when the sale will happen.Now fund managers are poring over bank research about the famously secretive company, but little certainty has been provided by even analysts from the Wall Street giants with roles in the Riyadh bourse listing, five sources told Reuters.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said he wants a $2 trillion valuation, seeking to raise billions of dollars in the IPO to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries.That figure is almost twice that of Microsoft, currently the world's most valuable listed company and seven times that of Exxon Mobil Corp, the most valuable listed oil major by market cap.Analysts from banks working on the deal have met with Aramco's management in Dhahran over the past month to get more information on the company, but their valuations of Aramco still vary by around $1 trillion.Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a range of $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion while EFG Hermes says $1.55 trillion to $2.1 trillion, two fund managers who have seen the research reports said.Goldman Sachs - one of the IPO coordinators - has put the company's valuation between $1.6 trillion and $2.3 trillion, two separate sources said. Credit Suisse's research offers a similarly wide range in value, one of the fund managers said.A major factor in the wide range is the various assumptions analysts are making for the future direction of oil prices, said a source familiar with the deal.The banks were not immediately available for comment.Sources have told Reuters that Aramco could offer 1%-2% of its shares, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion. A deal over $25 billion would top the record-breaking IPO of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014.Aramco Chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan said a decision on an international listing would be made in the future, without giving a timeframe or venue.ROADSHOWS AND RISKAramco did provide investors with some extra financial information on Sunday and Monday, including its detailed nine-month earnings, which showed net income fell to $68.2 billion by the end of September 30, down from $83.1 billion a year earlier.The company did not give any reason for the fall in earnings, but it likely reflects lower oil prices compared with 2018.In 2016, when the oil price hit 13-year lows, Aramco's net income was only $13 billion, according to a company bond prospectus this year, compared to $111 billion in 2018.Its net income for the third quarter of 2019 amounted to $21.1 billion, according to Reuters calculations. By contrast, Exxon Mobil's income for the same period was just over $3 billion.Aramco said it did not expect the Sept. 14 attacks, which targeted plants at the heart of Saudi Arabia's oil industry and initially halved its production, would have a material impact on its business, operations and financial condition.However the attacks underlined the potential political risk associated with the state company. Saudi Arabia blamed regional arch-rival Iran, a charge rejected by Tehran.The analysts' roadshow for Aramco, where analysts from banks working on the IPO speak to investors, began in the Middle East on Sunday and will run for a fortnight, a source familiar with the deal said, adding 26 to 27 analysts would be in different parts of the world at different times.Roadshows involving senior management will begin after the analysts' investor meetings the source said, adding pricing was likely to be announced around Nov. 28.Other roadshow locations are Japan, China and the usual suspects - London, New York, Boston, Hong Kong and Singapore, said another source close to the deal.ASSET MANAGER UNDECIDEDLegal & General Investment Management, one of Britains biggest asset managers, has not yet decided whether to invest in Aramco, its chief investment officer Sonja Laud told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit on Monday.

"Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, is expected to file its IPO prospectus by the end of the month, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal.The prospectus will reportedly first be published in Arabic on Oct. 25 and then in English two days later, according to a timeline seen by the Journal.The state-owned oil enterprise will list its shares on Saudi Arabia's Tadawul exchange, as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's economic reform plan. The crown prince anticipates listing 5% of the company in total domestically and internationally by 2020 or 2021. If the Saudi government decides to move forward with the listing, 1% to 2% of Aramco's shares will be listed domestically by late November or early December, people familiar with the matter said.The crown prince has indicated that he wants a valuation of $2 trillion, though analysts and Aramco officials have valued Aramco at closer to $1.5 trillion.The Aramco IPO was delayed in 2018, reportedly over Saudi officials' concerns about public scrutiny of the company's finances. A drone and missile strike in September temporarily knocked out more than half of Saudi Arabia's oil output, though officials stressed at the time that the Aramco IPO scheduling was not impacted.Aramco did not respond to the Journal's request for comment, and declined to comment in response to a request from CNBC.Read the full Wall Street Journal story here.Correction: The drone and missile strike in September temporarily knocked out more than half of Saudi Arabia's oil output.

"The  initial public offering of Saudi Arabia’s big oil company could be priced right in the middle of what could be a volatile period for oil.Saudi Aramco intends to price its IPO on Dec. 5, the same day OPEC begins its regular two-day meeting in Vienna. The Aramco stock, equal to 0.5% of the company, is expected to trade on the Saudi Tadawul Exchange several days later, and market talk has focused on Saudi Arabia’s desire for higher and steadier prices.Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been looking for a $2 trillion value for Aramco, but bankers have said it is worth more like $1.5 trillion. Aramco said the company is worth $1.5 trillion at an oil price of $45; $1.76 trillion at $65, and $2.1 trillion at $75 per barrel, according to  reports.Analysts say there could be conflicts at OPEC’s meeting this year,. Saudi Arabia has been trying to rein in producers, such as Iraq and Nigeria, which are not complying with the production cuts OPEC agreed to with Russia and others. Some traders expect the agreed cuts of 1.2 million barrels a day to be increased, but Saudi Arabia is reportedly not in favor of changing the target until at least March, when the agreement runs out.“Obviously, the biggest thing that’s going to decide where crude prices go in the next two or three weeks is going to be the OPEC meeting,”  said Michael Bradley, energy analyst with Tudor, Pickering Holt. “My guess is the next two or three weeks we’re going to hear people staking out positions from a commodities standpoint.”Bradley said some traders are looking for a potential new cut in production, though Reuters has quoted sources saying Saudi Arabia does not expect to change production targets, which expire in March.“It looks like Russia is being a little bit antsy and not willing to move, and you have the Aramco IPO is pretty much intertwined with that meeting,” said Bradley. Underwriters are expected to run a book-building process between Nov. 17 and Dec. 4, during which time institutional investors will be expected to submit orders.Brent crude, the international benchmark, has been trading mostly below $65 a barrel since June. Before that, it hit a high of just under $75 in April. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been a factor holding down prices, as have expectations for reduced demand growth and increased supply from the U.S. and elsewhere.Oil prices have been lagging, as the U.S., Brazil, Norway and Ghana increase production, while OPEC and its allies cut back. Bradley said OPEC members are overproducing by about 500,000 barrels a day, and non U.S. producers outside of OPEC could increase their output by between 400,000 and 600,000 barrels a day next year. U.S. producers could increase production by 700,000 barrels a day or more next year.If there is a trade deal, demand growth could grow by 1.3 million or 1.4 million barrels a day next year, and that would help lift prices, Bradley said. Without it, demand could grow less than 1 million barrels per day.In the meantime, OPEC plus, which includes Russia, has been trying to keep the price steady and higher, but trade tensions have been a wild card weighing on the price.President Donald Trump and China President Xi Jinping are widely expected to come to terms on a first phase trade deal by mid-December, and there has been speculation that they could meet at the NATO meeting Dec. 3 and 4. If there’s a deal, that would be a powerful upside catalyst for oil, and OPEC could be less likely to quibble over production levels. If there’s no deal, a new wave of tariffs on Chinese goods are expected Dec. 15.“It’s a high wire act,”  said John Kilduff of Again Capital. “They run the risk at the same time of their meeting falling apart, and the oil price tanking. It’s a fraught history. To think this is shooting fish in a barrel is an absurd notion to me.” Kilduff said while Iraq and Nigeria have been overproducing, Venezuela and Iran have been overcomplying. Both countries are being sanctioned by the U.S.Oman’s energy minister said Monday that OPEC should extend its existing deal, but it is unlikely to deepen the cuts.“They don’t want the price to collapse going into the meeting, but they don’t necessarily need it to go much higher,” said a source, familiar with OPEC’s thinking. The source said Saudi Arabia has a long term view that its oil company’s stock price could fluctuate with oil prices but that longer term, it’s going higher.Bradley said Saudi probably wants a price above $65 per barrel for Brent going into the pricing, but longer term it would be fine at $60 to $65. Brent was at $62.19 per barrel in late trading Monday.Besides oil price risk, Aramco highlighted other risks for investors in its report of a sharp drop in profits, related to the attack on its facilities in September. Aramco said its quarterly revenue declined in line with oil prices, but its profits fell to $21.2 billion from $30.3 billion due to purchases and other costs. Aramco resumed production within weeks of the attack on its Abqaiq and Khurais facilities but it had to buy imported oil for its refineries.",pos
"You don’t have to tell Willis Williams that the initial public offering calendar has been busy this year.Williams, 44, a New York area digital marketing strategist who helps create advertising campaigns for social media, has been regularly tracking which companies are going public and when.His goal: To buy the shares of the companies early so that he can be in on it if the stock takes off.Williams’ interest in IPOs started with Twitter, which went public in 2013, and then extended to other newly public companies such as Uber, which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in May.More from Personal Finance:Losses at Fisher Investments hit $1.8 billion as Fidelity exitsThe 10 best places to vacation on a budgetTips to get your Medicare drug coverage rightTo stay up to date, he tracks when those shares will become available to retail investors through his brokerage account.“I really missed out on Google,” Williams said of the company’s 2004 IPO, which saw its shares rise 18.05% on its opening day to close at $100.34. Fifteen years later, the stock had climbed by more than 2,600%.“I am a strong believer in buying into companies you use or you really like,” Williams said. “As soon as it opens, I buy it.”Investors such as Williams have been in luck this year, with familiar brands — including Uber, Lyft, Levi Strauss and Pinterest — opting to raise money on the public markets.IPOs allow private companies to raise money by selling shares publicly. The companies typically list on the public markets, such as the NYSE or Nasdaq, giving public investors the ability to invest in those stocks. The company’s existing private investors, meanwhile, often have access to those shares at a premium.The market’s appetite for new IPOs is still strong, if the upcoming listing of oil company Saudi Aramco — poised to be the largest IPO to date — is any indication.But there are some key things to keep in mind if you’re an investor looking to wade into these deals.It may not be easy to get in on an IPO deal early.That’s because to participate, you often have to have an account at a brokerage firm that is participating in the deal, notes Barry Glassman, founder and president of Glassman Wealth Services, with offices in Vienna, Virginia, and North Bethesda, Maryland.The deal’s availability may also be limited by how many shares are actually going public and how much demand there is for the offering, Glassman, a certified financial planner, said.“We’ve seen investors request shares, and then get a much smaller allocation, or a token allocation, or shut out from the allocation,” he said.Investors who are interested in an IPO can start by checking with the financial institutions with which they’re currently affiliated to see if they can get in.But those same investors would be wise not to rush, according to JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.“You don’t have to be the first one to the party,” Kinahan said. “Too often, people get very excited about a product, and a great product does not necessarily mean a great stock.”Whether you invest in an IPO or not should first be determined by whether it makes sense for you personally before you consider the particular investment’s risks.One important question to ask yourself: What’s my time frame?“If you’re in just for some quick flip, that’s a very risky type of investing behavior,” Kinahan said. “There’s a reason that it often doesn’t work out really well, because it’s hard.”If you do plan to hold onto the stock longer, it’s also important to keep in mind that you don’t necessarily want to wager your safe investments — the funds you will rely on in retirement — on a risky bet.The ideal investor for an IPO, according to Winnie Sun, founder of Sun Group Wealth Partners in Irvine, California, is someone with a high net worth, who has been in the market for a long time and who has a hold mentality.Another key point they need to be able to check off, Sun said: No outstanding personal debts aside from a mortgage.Once you’re convinced you are able and willing to take on the risk personally, it’s important to assess the particular investment’s risks.If 2019 is any indication, that will include winners and losers. Beyond Meat turned in one of the best first-day trading performances, when its stock climbed 163%.But the recent expiration of its lockup period, when inside investors can sell the stock, sent the share price down by more than 20%.Weak demand led WeWork to ultimately pull its IPO plans and reassess its strategy.“There are periods in time where the great successes are so great, they blur out the handful that don’t work out,” Glassman said. “2019 has been a balanced year of hits and flops.”In order to really know what you’re getting into, investors should study a company’s disclosures, such as the Form S-1 filing with the SEC. Companies that are listing in the U.S. are required to file that disclosure, which outlines all the potential risks of investing in their business.One way investors can also protect themselves: avoiding an all-or-nothing mentality, according to Kinahan.“If you have 300 shares to buy, maybe you buy 100 to start,” Kinahan said. Having a partial mentality can help investors avoid panicked transactions both on the way in and out of an investment, he said.",pos

"Saudi Aramco has delayed the planned launch of its initial public offering, as the giant oil company wants to update investors with its latest earnings before proceeding, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.The world’s largest oil firm was to announce plans next week to float a 1% to 2% stake on the kingdom’s Tadawul market before a possible international listing.However, after a Sept. 14 attack on its Abqaiq and Khurais plants knocked out half the crude output of the world’s top exporter, Aramco wants to reassure investors by presenting results covering the period, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is not public.“They want to do all they can to hit the valuation target, so solid results after the attack will give them a stronger position,” said one of the sources.The second source said the offering had been postponed, and there was currently no new date set for the listing.The Financial Times, which initially reported the IPO delay, cited a source as saying the listing has been delayed by “weeks.”Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment outside regular working hours.Aramco executives had previously insisted the infrastructure attack, which initially knocked out 5.7 million barrels per day of production — or more than 5% of global oil supply — would have no impact on its plans for listing the company.Earlier this month, Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said Saudi Arabia had fully restored oil output, which allowed it to focus on the IPO.However, sources familiar with the IPO told Reuters on Sept. 24 that the offering was unlikely to happen this year, given the impact of the attacks.Aramco’s Riyadh listing is the first step towards an eventual sale of up to 5%, sources have told Reuters.The prospect of the world’s largest oil company selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Crown Prince Mohammed first flagged it three years ago.Initial hopes for a blockbuster international listing of around 5% were dashed when the share sale was halted last year amid debate over where to list Aramco’s shares overseas.Saudi investors see the IPO as a chance to own part of the kingdom’s crown jewel and an opportunity to show patriotism after the attack.",pos

"* Cornerstone investors help to bolster IPO demand* Valuation concerns remain a sticking point* Aramco wants anchor investors to cover no less than 40% -sourceDUBAI/RIYADH, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Oil giant Saudi Aramco’s much-vaunted stock market listing was delayed after deal advisers said they need more time to lock in cornerstone investors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.After a false start last year, preparations gathered momentum this summer with approaches to sovereign wealth funds, rich Saudis and large foreign fund managers as potential cornerstone investors only for plans to unravel for a second time.The world’s biggest oil company had been expected last week to launch the domestic sale of a 1-2% stake, but the signing up of marquee backers has been hampered by continuing valuation concerns exacerbated by recent attacks on Aramco’s Abqaiq and Khurais plants.Aramco was unable to answer valuation questions fully during initial talks with investors, said one Gulf institutional investor who has been involved in the discussions.Sovereign funds in the oil-rich Gulf region typically shy away from energy exposure, he added, looking to diversify their investment portfolio.Two of the sources said that an Aramco committee overseeing the planned flotation had therefore recommended to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last Wednesday that the launch of an initial public offering (IPO) scheduled for Oct. 20 be postponed.The prince, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, has made the Aramco IPO a pillar of an ambitious economic reform drive. He wants the company to be valued at about $2 trillion, though bankers and company insiders put the value closer to $1.5 trillion.Aramco declined to comment and the Saudi government media office did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.Banks involved in the offering received news of the delay on Thursday evening. An email from top advisers said that a call with bankers on Friday to discuss strategy to secure investors was canceled, as was the Sunday launch, said one banker who saw the email.The rationale was that third-quarter results, which one of the sources said could come before the end of October, would bolster investor confidence after the Sept. 14 attacks initially halved Aramco’s output and shook oil markets.ANCHOR INVESTORSTalks have taken place with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore’s GIC and other funds, sources have told Reuters.Newly appointed Aramco chairman Yasir al-Rumayyan, who also heads Saudi wealth fund PIF, is pushing banks to achieve the top valuation, said a fourth source familiar with the IPO plan.Anchor, or cornerstone, investors such sovereign wealth funds are considered key to secure demand. In 2016 state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China sold 77% of its $7.4 billion IPO to such backers.“They (Aramco) will want anchor investors to cover no less than 40% of the offering.

"(Adds details and background)RIYADH, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has received bids for its shares totalling $44.3 billion so far, lead manager Samba Capital said on Friday, putting its initial public offering on track to be over-subscribed.The state-owned oil giant plans to sell 1.5% of the company's shares for as much as 96 billion riyals ($25.6 billion), a deal which would give it a market value of $1.7 trillion.Overall demand so far totals 1.7 times the amount of shares on offer, with institutional investors having until Dec 4 to put their bids in.In the first update on institutional investor interest in the listing, Samba said it had received bids from them worth 118.86 billion riyal($31.70 billion).The retail tranche of the offering - which closed to subscribers on Thursday - has had bids totalling 47.4 billion riyals ($12.64 billion), around 1.5 times the amount of shares on offer to retail investors. While comfortably oversubscribed, the level of interest is relatively muted compared to other Saudi IPOs.When Saudi Arabias National Commercial Bank listed in 2014 the retail portion was 23 times over-subscribed.Aramco is relying on local and regional demand to pull off its listing, after cancelling marketing roadshows outside the Gulf region due to a lack of interest from foreign institutional investors.Sources told Reuters this week that the sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi and Kuwait planned to invest in the IPO, which could be the world's biggest if it tops the $25 billion record set by China's Alibaba in 2014.

"Saudi Arabia needs the initial public offering (IPO) of its state oil company to be successful as it needs to attract outside investment and, frankly, it needs the money, the former chief of the CIA David Petraeus told CNBC Thursday.“It’s a fact that Saudi Arabia is gradually running out of money, they’d be the first to acknowledge that the sovereign wealth fund has been reduced, it’s somewhere below $500 billion now,” Gen. David Petraeus, who is currently chair of the KKR Global Institute, told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble in Abu Dhabi.“The (budget) deficits each year, depending on the price of Brent crude, can be anywhere from $40 to $60 billion depending on some of their activities in countries in the region.”“The bottom line is that they need the money, they need that outside investment that is crucial to delivering ‘Vision 2030’ which cannot be realized without outside investment, this is just one component of a number of different initiatives that they’re pursuing to try to attract that outside investment,” he added.Saudi Arabia is going to float a small portion of its state oil giant Saudi Aramco, the most profitable company in the world, in December. The IPO was first flagged in 2016 by the now-Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He said then that he believed the company was worth around $2 trillion. The listing is seen as part of the crown prince’s “Vision 2030” program of economic and social reforms designed to diversify the kingdom’s economy and reduce its dependence on oil.Saudi Arabia does not openly publish the amount of assets it holds within its sovereign wealth fund, known as the Public Investment Fund (PIF). The Institute of International Finance estimated in a report in June that the kingdom has assets worth around $300 billion with roughly a quarter of its holdings overseas. The Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute puts the figure closer to $320 billion. On its website, PIF says it “seeks to become one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world.” Saudi Arabia’s economy is still largely reliant on oil exports, and lackluster oil prices (a barrel of Brent crude is currently priced at $63) have prompted the country’s budget deficit (the amount by which its spending exceeds its revenues) to widen. In 2018, the budget deficit was forecast at around 136 billion riyals (or around $36 billion), according to the kingdom’s Ministry of Finance. It’s expected to be a similar amount in 2019. And in 2020, the kingdom expects the deficit to widen to $50 billion, the kingdom’s finance minister said in October, according to Reuters.Aramco has not yet revealed all the details of the size and scale of its share offering but said last weekend that it will sell up to 0.5% of its shares to individual investors. The listing on Saudi’s Tadawul exchange next month could form part of the largest IPO in history. A final offer price, as well as the number and percentage of company shares that will be sold, will be determined in early December. Analysts’ valuations of the company have varied from $1.2 trillion to $2.3 trillion.Petraeus said there were “a number of different elements that will determine the success of Vision 2030” and that it was in “everyone’s interests” to see the kingdom succeed and to see it carry out reforms.He said there had been some “missteps — some of them truly grievous, the horrific murder of (Saudi journalist Jamal) Khashoggi being foremost among those” but added that “at the end of the day, we all want Saudi Arabia to succeed, and for that to happen Vision 2030 is some element of that.”The murder of Khashoggi, a journalist and vocal critic of the Saudi regime, in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018 at the hands of a Saudi hit squad caused an international uproar. Saudi Arabia denied any involvement in the murder but a United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions said in the summer that the evidence suggested that Khashoggi was “the victim of a deliberate, premeditated execution, an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible under international human rights law.”The murder shook investor confidence with many big name investors and companies pulling out of the much vaunted Future Investment Initiative investment conference in Saudi Arabia last year. Petraeus said he was also among those who canceled his attendance.Asked if global investment firm KKR (whose Global Institute he chairs) would put money into Saudi Arabia, Petraeus said it needed to regain investor confidence.He said KKR had put money in the region, having put $2 billion into the UAE’s Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) (together with BlackRock which also put in $2 billion), but said that was the first direct investment by KKR in the region.“We are looking elsewhere in the region. But as we do that we evaluate not just the financial aspects of the deal but also the geopolitical and security risks, the macroeconomic situation and the environmental, social and governance issues.”“You have to have confidence in the rule of law. And what Saudi Arabia has to do is regain confidence of all the investors of the world so that it can attract the kind of outside investment that is necessary for Vision 2030′s success.”",pos
"sources@* Bankers approached Gulf, Asian sovereign funds - sources* Sovereign funds have yet to study proposals - source* Meeting with Abu Dhabi's ADIA set for October - sourceLONDON/DUBAI/SINGAPORE, Sept 26 (Reuters) - State-owned Saudi Aramco has approached Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), Singapore's GIC and other sovereign wealth funds to invest in the domestic leg of the oil giant's listing at it seeks to achieve a $2 trillion valuation, sources said.After initial conversations in recent months between Saudi Arabia and governments in the Gulf and Asia, approaches to their sovereign wealth funds have started via the banks appointed to handle Aramco's initial public offering (IPO), the sources said.A meeting between Aramco's management and a team from Abu Dhabi's ADIA, the world's third-biggest sovereign wealth fund, was set up for October, one of the sources told Reuters.A second source confirmed the approach to ADIA, while two other sources said GIC had been approached.All the sources who spoke to Reuters asked to be anonymous as they were not authorised to speak to the media.Abu Dhabi's state investor Mubadala Investment Co, which has $229 billion under management, has also been approached by Aramco's advisers, two sources said.One of the sources said the approaches were still at an early stage and some of the funds had yet to study the proposals before deciding whether to invest.Among Gulf investors, Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat was expected to consider investing in the IPO, another source said.ADIA and Mubadala declined to comment, while Aramco and Mumtalakat did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The approaches to sovereign funds in countries on friendly terms with Saudi Arabia and wealthy Saudi families indicate bankers aimed to build an investor base to achieve the $2 trillion valuation targeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The listing is the centrepiece of the crown prince's plan to shake up the Saudi economy and diversify away from oil.The talks show work on the IPO process is still proceeding despite uncertainty over the timeline following a Sept. 14 attack on Aramco's facilities.LOFTY TARGETSTo achieve the $2 trillion valuation, Aramco needs the initial listing of a 1% stake on the Saudi market to raise at least $20 billion. To beat the record for the world's biggest IPO, it needs to top Alibaba's sale of $25 billion of shares.But bankers and company insiders have described the valuation as ambitious, due to a weak outlook for oil prices as deepening climate change activism could dampen investor interest, particularly in the Western world.A further risk to the $2 trillion target was raised by the Sept. 14 strikes that knocked out more than half the production of the world's top oil exporting nation. Saudi Arabia has been assuring investors it can quickly restore output.Various sources said the kingdom has been busy looking for a more sympathetic investor base in the Middle East and Asia, while also seeking support from the wealthiest Saudi families.""It is a natural fit and many in the region would look at it favourably as they want a piece of the pie,"" a Gulf source said.Preparations for the IPO have gone through various stages since the 2016 announcement.Issues of governance and disclosure, the acquisition of a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp , disagreements among Saudi officials and advisers over the choice of an international listing venue, all contributed to a temporary halt last year.Bankers from around 20 international and domestic financial institutions are now working on the company's plan to sell 1% in Riyadh before an international sale in 2020 or 2021.After securing support from sovereign funds, bankers would focus on Western institutional investors, another source said.""There's no turning back now,"" one of the sources said, adding that Aramco was ""going ahead"" with the IPO.One of the sources said Aramco could announce its intention to float on Oct. 20, with analysts' reports expected the same day.

"* Cornerstone investors help to bolster IPO demand* Valuation concerns remain a sticking point* Aramco wants anchor investors to cover no less than 40% -source (Adds description of IPO committee and who heads it)DUBAI/RIYADH, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Oil giant Saudi Aramco’s much-vaunted stock market listing was delayed after deal advisers said they need more time to lock in cornerstone investors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.After a false start last year, preparations gathered momentum this summer with approaches to sovereign wealth funds, rich Saudis and large foreign fund managers as potential cornerstone investors only for plans to unravel for a second time.The world’s biggest oil company had been expected last week to launch the domestic sale of a 1-2% stake, but the signing up of marquee backers has been hampered by continuing valuation concerns exacerbated by recent attacks on Aramco’s Abqaiq and Khurais plants.Aramco was unable to answer valuation questions fully during initial talks with investors, said one Gulf institutional investor who has been involved in the discussions.Sovereign funds in the oil-rich Gulf region typically shy away from energy exposure, he added, looking to diversify their investment portfolio.Two of the sources said that a Saudi government committee overseeing the planned Aramco flotation had therefore recommended to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last Wednesday that the launch of an initial public offering (IPO) scheduled for Oct. 20 be postponed.The chief of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund PIF, Yasir al-Rumayyan, heads the committee, which includes senior Saudi officials, sources said. He is also the newly appointed chairman of Aramco.Aramco declined to comment and the Saudi government media office did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.The prince, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, has made the Aramco IPO a pillar of an ambitious economic reform drive. He wants the company to be valued at about $2 trillion, though bankers and company insiders put the value closer to $1.5 trillion.Banks involved in the offering received news of the delay on Thursday evening. An email from top advisers said that a call with bankers on Friday to discuss strategy to secure investors was cancelled, as was the Sunday launch, said one banker who saw the email.The rationale was that third-quarter results, which one of the sources said could come before the end of October, would bolster investor confidence after the Sept. 14 attacks initially halved Aramco’s output and shook oil markets.ANCHOR INVESTORSTalks have taken place with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore’s GIC and other funds, sources have told Reuters.Al-Rumayyan is pushing banks to achieve the top valuation, said a fourth source familiar with the IPO plan.Anchor, or cornerstone, investors such sovereign wealth funds are considered key to secure demand. In 2016 state-owned Postal Savings Bank of China sold 77% of its $7.4 billion IPO to such backers.“They (Aramco) will want anchor investors to cover no less than 40% of the offering. Anything below that won’t be enough,” said one of the three sources close to the deal.The latest delay in the plan to hold what could be one of the world’s largest public offerings -- potentially raising upwards of $20 billion from the sale of 5% of Aramco in total -- has revived debate on whether Saudi Arabia can ever realise its valuation target given moribund oil prices.“The current oil price environment is not favourable for the $2 trillion target,” said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School of Economics.“Aramco expects the oil market to recover over the coming few years.

"DUBAI/ABU DHABI, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Analysts provided wide valuation estimates for Saudi Aramco, ranging between $1.2 trillion and $2.3 trillion, fund managers who have seen research notes said, as the oil giant kick-started its initial public offering (IPO) on the local bourse.Bank analysts started showing IPO research to fund managers soon after Aramco, the world’s most profitable company, on Sunday announced its intention to float on the domestic bourse in what could be the world’s biggest listing.The research reports highlight the challenge faced in hitting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s initial valuation target of $2 trillion for the world’s largest oil producer, with some banks having said it could be about $1.5 trillion.Bank of America (BOFA) Merrill Lynch estimates Aramco’s valuation could range from a low of $1.2 trillion to a high of $2.3 trillion, while EFG Hermes has an equity valuation of $1.55 trillion to $2.1 trillion, two fund managers who have seen the research reports told Reuters.The banks were not immediately available for comment.BOFA Merrill’s research is based on the discounted-cash-flow model, a valuation methodology that uses future cash flow, according to one fund manager who saw the research.Credit Suisse’s research also has similar wide ranges, the fund manager said.“These ranges are always wide as research analysts want to cover both low end and high end so you want to show sensitivity of assumptions,” one analyst said.EFG Hermes research implies a 2020 estimated enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 6.9 times to 9.4 times, a price-to earnings ratio of 14.5 times to 19.5 times, and a dividend yield of 3.9% to 5.3%.Aramco’s long-awaited announcement on Sunday did not disclose the number of shares to be sold, pricing or the date for a launch.Sources have told Reuters Aramco could offer 1%-2% of its shares on the Riyadh exchange, raising as much as $20 billion to $40 billion.

"Nov 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco set a price range for its blockbuster listing that implies the oil giant is worth between $1.6 trillion and $1.7 trillion, below the $2 trillion Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman previously targeted.Below are key facts about Aramco:HISTORYExplorers from the Rockefeller family's Standard Oil Company struck oil in Saudi Arabia in 1938. The venture became known as the Arabia American Oil Company and crude oil production hit 500,000 barrels per day in 1949.By 1980, the Saudi government had bought out all the original shareholders and owned 100% of the company. Eight years later, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco) was officially established.Aramco has fuelled decades of prosperity in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom is the de facto leader of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, helping engineer price moves on world oil markets.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman wants to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil. Announcing plans for an Aramco IPO in 2016, he said the kingdom must end its ""oil addiction"" to ensure it was no longer at the mercy of commodity price volatility.OIL RESERVESAramco had 260.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent in 2017, larger than the combined reserves of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and Total SA. The reserves have an estimated life of 54 years.OIL PRODUCTIONThe company produced 10.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude last year, touting the lowest production cost in the world, at $2.80 a barrel, according to company documents. It also produced 1.1 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 8.9 billion standard cubic feet per day of natural gas.OIL EXPORTSAlmost three-quarters of Aramco's crude exports, about 5.2 million bpd, were delivered to customers in Asia last year, where it believes demand will grow faster than elsewhere in the world. Its Asian buyers include China, India, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan. Its crude deliveries to North America reached more than 1 million bpd last year; to Europe, 864,000 bpd.OIL REFININGTo diversify its oil business, Aramco is expanding in refining and petrochemicals with the aim of almost tripling its chemicals production to 34 million tonnes per year by 2030 and raising its global refining capacity to 8-10 million bpd from more than 5 million bpd.The company produces, refines and exports oil from Saudi Arabia, but also has refining operations across the globe. Aramco's U.S. oil refining subsidiary Motiva Enterprises owns the 607,000 bpd Port Arthur refinery in Texas, the largest in the United States. In 2017 the company announced plans for $18 billion in investments in its operations in the Americas over five years.Aramco is also expanding its oil refining and downstream capacity, particularly in rapidly growing countries such as China and India. Aramco had a net refining capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day in 2018.SCALEThe state-owned firm is the world's largest oil producer, pumping 10% of the world's supply, and the most profitable company with its half-year net profit rising 12% to $46.9 billion.Last year, Aramco made an annual net profit of $111 billion, over a third bigger than the combined net income of the five ""super majors"" Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, Chevron and Total.With 76,000 employees in 2018, Aramco has energy industry operations, research facilities and offices scattered across the globe, in Asia, Europe and the Americas. It has country offices in Beijing, New Delhi, Singapore, New York, London, Houston and elsewhere. (Reporting by Dahlia Nehme; Editing by Carmel Crimmins, Gerry Doyle and Pravin Char)",pos
"(Adds details)DUBAI, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead its planned initial public offering (IPO), slated to be the world’s largest, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.The mandates have been heavily sought by the world’s largest investment banks for a transaction which, according to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s initial plans, could generate around $100 billion for Saudi Arabia’s state coffers.The kingdom plans to list 1% of the state oil giant on the Riyadh stock exchange before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020, sources told Reuters this week, as initial steps ahead of a public sale of around 5% of Aramco.Aramco has selected JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Saudi Arabia’s National Commercial Bank, which were previously working on the share sale before it was paused last year, the sources said, declining to be identified due to commercial sensitivities.It has also chosen Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Citi, HSBC and Saudi Arabia’s Samba, they added.JPMorgan and Bank of America declined to comment. Aramco and the remaining banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The IPO plan has rapidly gained momentum in recent days with the appointment of the head of the kingdom’s PIF sovereign wealth fund, Yasser al-Rumayyan, as Aramco’s new chairman.Bankers have been courting Saudi Arabia to secure roles in the transaction, which has faced repeated delays, but which officials have said will happen by 2020-2021.Aramco’s chief executive, Amin Nasser, said this week that the domestic IPO would be the “primary” listing but that the company was also ready for an international share sale.

"ABU DHABI — Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company, is prepared for a listing on the Riyadh stock exchange and it will take place “very soon,” its CEO said Tuesday.“What we have always said is that Aramco is ready for listing whenever the shareholders make a decision to list,” Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser told reporters at the World Energy Conference in Abu Dhabi.“And as you heard from His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz yesterday, it is going to be very soon. So, we are ready — that is the bottom line.”Nasser also confirmed the state oil giant’s aims to list internationally in addition to Saudi Arabia, though did not specify which other locations are under consideration.“The primary listing is to list locally but we are ready also for listing outside in other districts,” Nasser said.When asked whether he would prefer to see Aramco list in Tokyo, Japan, he replied: “We are ready to list wherever shareholders decide.”Reuters reported on Monday that the kingdom plans to list 1% of Aramco on its local stock exchange before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020, citing sources, as first steps ahead of a public sale of roughly 5% of the company.The oil giant has delayed its IPO, originally scheduled for 2018, reportedly over Saudi concerns about public scrutiny over its finances and because of the complexity of its corporate structure. The listing would be the largest public offering in history.Speaking on Monday, new Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman underlined the importance of regulation for Saudi Aramco, as it gears up for its long-anticipated IPO.“I have no doubt in my mind that emphasizing the separation between Aramco, the corporate, and the ministry as regulator is a must,” he told CNBC contributor Helima Croft at an audience of delegates.“The regulator cannot be a person, the regulator has to be an institution. That regulator role has to be defined, and the contours of the role of the regulator has to be understood,” he added.The Aramco listing would aim to drum up cash for a government looking to significantly reduce its budget deficit and diversify its economy beyond oil as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030.",pos
"Saudi Aramco is considering Tokyo — instead of early favorites London and Hong Kong — as the international destination to list its shares, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.The initial public offering of Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant’s shares will take place over two stages: A flotation on the Saudi stock exchange later this year, followed by an international listing in 2020 or 2021, the Journal reported, citing advisors and officials familiar with the plans.Aramco’s IPO, when it goes ahead, is expected to be the world’s largest.The company had targeted to raise $100 billion through selling 5% of its share in the public markets, but it’s not clear what the final amount will be, according to the report.Many stock exchanges around the world have courted Aramco to list on their markets, with London and Hong Kong widely considered the front-runners to clinch the deal. But political uncertainties facing the two cities — arising from Brexit, the U.K.’s impending departure from the European Union, as well as prolonged protests in Hong Kong — have diminished their attractiveness, the report said.Still, Saudi officials and Aramco advisors told the Journal that while they’re leaning toward picking Tokyo, no final decision has been made and all options were still on the table.In response to CNBC’s request for comment, Aramco said it “continues to engage with the shareholder on IPO readiness activities.” The company added it “is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholder’s choosing.”A spokesman from Japan Exchange Group, which runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange, told CNBC the firm has not changed its stance of wanting Aramco to list on its market.For the full report on Aramco’s IPO plans, read The Wall Street Journal.",pos
"(Adds company comment)DUBAI/RIYADH, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco <IPO-ARMO.SE> has delayed the planned launch of its initial public offering in hopes that pending third-quarter results will bolster investor confidence in the world’s largest oil firm, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Aramco had been expected to announce plans next week to float a 1% to 2% stake on the kingdom’s Tadawul market, in what would have been one of the largest ever public offerings, worth upwards of $20 billion.However, after a Sept. 14 attack on its Abqaiq and Khurais plants temporarily knocked out half its crude output, the world’s top exporter wants to reassure investors by first presenting results covering the period, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is not public.“They want to do all that they can to hit the valuation target. Solid results after the attack will put them in a stronger position,” said one of the sources.The second source confirmed the offering had been postponed, and there was currently no new date set for the listing. Neither source knew when third quarter results were likely to come out.In a statement to Reuters on Friday, Saudi Aramco said: “The company continues to engage with the shareholders on IPO readiness activities. The company is ready and timing will depend on market conditions and be at a time of the shareholders’ choosing.”The news comes after Reuters, citing sources familiar with the IPO, reported on Sept. 24 that the offering was unlikely to happen this year in light of the attacks.The Financial Times, which initially reported the IPO delay on Thursday, cited a source as saying the listing was delayed by “weeks”.The prospect of Aramco selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first flagged it three years ago.However, his desired $2 trillion valuation has always been questioned by some financiers and industry experts who note that countries have been accelerating efforts to shift away from fossil fuels to curb global warming, putting oil prices under pressure and undermining producers’ equity value.Then came the September attack, which initially knocked out 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production, or more than 5% of global oil supply.Aramco executives have insisted since the attack that it would have no impact on its plans to list the company. The full restoration of oil output as declared by Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Oct. 3 - at a faster clip than expected - was seen boosting the company’s image.“The official line was that the Q3 results were very good, so they want to update the analysts and market the IPO after the Q3 numbers,” the second source said.Aramco halted plans for a blockbuster international listing of around 5% last year amid debate over where to list overseas, but talks resumed this summer.They were given impetus by the appointment of Yasir al-Rumayyan, a close ally of Prince Mohammed and former investment banker, as chairman of Aramco. A host of banks were given roles to arrange the listing.Saudi investors see the IPO as a chance to own part of the kingdom’s crown jewel and an opportunity to show patriotism after the attack.

"(Adds comments by Jordanian and Indian leaders, Kushner)RIYADH, Oct 29 (Reuters) - What a difference a year makes.There was standing room only in the expansive halls of Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel on Tuesday as the world’s financial royalty attended Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference, aimed at courting global investors.Saudi Arabia said it signed more than two dozen investment deals worth $15 billion in total, mostly in manufacturing, as the kingdom strives to show Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s diversification plan is on track after limited progress since the first FII forum in 2017.Last year’s event was overshadowed by the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi as dozens of Western leaders and executives boycotted the gathering.On Tuesday, bosses of HSBC, Blackstone, BlackRock, Colony Capital and Evercore were among the crowd at the luxury hotel that less than 24 months ago served as one of the detention centres for more than 200 businessmen, ministers and princes during a corruption purge that had unnerved investors.The United States sent a big delegation including its energy and treasury secretaries, and senior White House advisor Jared Kushner. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are also participating in the Oct. 29-31 event, as is the head of the World Bank.Prince Mohammed in 2016 launched a plan to transform the economy of the world’s largest crude exporter by developing non-energy industries. But state oil giant Aramco remains the biggest draw for investors eager for news on its initial public offering which has had several false starts.ARAMCO LUREAramco CEO Amin Nasser was absent from the conference as he was meeting investors abroad to secure a domestic IPO on Nov. 3 after a delay earlier this month, three people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.It could be the largest listing in history, if the $2 trillion valuation target sought by the crown prince is met.“There are several Russian pensions funds who are interested to invest in the Aramco IPO and we have also received indications from our Russia-China fund of some Chinese major institutions also interested,” Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said on the sidelines of the meeting.In addition to deals announced on Tuesday, which include a $120 million investment deal between the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority and BRF Brazil Foods, other agreements include a memorandum of understanding between Samsung and Saudi entertainment resort Qiddiya.One attendee who declined to be named said that while FII drew more participants this year, “the challenge is to see whether people will continue to come going forward, especially once the Aramco deal is out of the way”.REFORMS AND ROBOTSSome foreign investors have been wary of ploughing money into Saudi Arabia due to concern over its human rights record and the commercial viability of some projects.But attendees on Tuesday said the turnout was impressive and reflected reforms to modernise the largest Arab economy.Kushner and Modi lauded the kingdom’s reform drive at sessions attended by Crown Prince Mohammed, who has yet to address the gathering.Kushner urged regional leaders to make tough decisions to secure investment, citing the economic portion of a U.S. Middle East peace plan whose political dimension has not been revealed.“If things were easy and obvious, they would have been done a long time ago,” he said in a panel discussion.Jordan’s King Abdullah said in a speech that investment in the Middle East was a “good business opportunity” that would empower a new generation.Reinforcing a technology theme at the conference, SoftBank Corp’s humanoid robot Pepper greeted attendees. Boston Dynamics’ robot dog was on display along with a 3D interactive booth for Saudi’s planned Red Sea tourism.Some Saudi women opted not to wear the traditional black abaya covering this year, highlighting social reforms to open up the conservative Muslim kingdom.“The speed of the change has been phenomenal. We still have a way to go but we have made tremendous improvement. Allowing women to work in any field was tremendous,” said billionaire Saudi businesswomen Lubna Olayan.JPMorgan’s global banking head, Carlos Hernandez, said Riyadh was on the right path in terms of capital markets reforms to make its stock exchange more attractive to foreign investors.“We’re very encouraged that they’re doing all the right things on the path to be the major hub in the region,” he said.(Reporting by Saeed Azhar, Stephen Kalin, Rania El Gamal, Marwa Rashad and Davide Barbuscia in Riyadh, with Hadeel El Sayegh in Dubai Writing by Maha El Dahan Editing by Pravin Char and David Holmes)",pos
"(Repeats with no changes to text)* Crown Prince has stuck to $2 trillion value for Aramco - sources* Banks puts Aramco value at $1.3-$1.7 trillion - sources* Aramco board scheduled to meet this week - sourceLONDON/RIYADH/DUBAI, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is insisting on a $2 trillion valuation of oil firm Aramco, even though some bankers and company insiders say the kingdom should trim its target to around $1.5 trillion, industry and banking sources said.With Aramco talking again to banks about an initial public offering (IPO), its board is meeting later this week and will probably hold a discussion about the company’s value, a source close to the company said.Saudi Aramco declined to comment. CIC, the Saudi government media office, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.Prince Mohammed put a $2 trillion valuation on the state company in early 2016 when he first proposed a share sale to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy beyond oil.He has stuck with that valuation, according to the source close to Aramco and another source familiar with the IPO plans, even though some banks think it will be a struggle. Over the past three years, countries have accelerated efforts to shift away from fossil fuels to curb global warming, putting oil prices under pressure.A valuation gap could hinder any share sale.“If the market didn’t value Aramco properly, there is no rush to IPO, they can always postpone,” the source familiar with the plans said.“They have the right tools to maneuver and aren’t in a weak position to IPO Aramco unless with a valuation that achieves the objectives of the vision and the national interest.”Even at the lower end of estimated valuations, an Aramco IPO would create the world’s largest public company. It would also bring unprecedented scrutiny on the kingdom. Months after the listing was shelved, Saudi Arabia came under Western pressure over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The initial plan to sell a 5 percent stake in Aramco was meant to raise funds for Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund to invest in non-oil sectors. When the IPO was shelved, the wealth fund sold a majority stake in petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) to Aramco for $69 billion instead.After the SABIC acquisition was announced, Saudi Aramco issued its first international bonds in April. The success of that debt sale, which attracted more than $100 billion in orders for a $12 billion issue, showed that pressure on the kingdom over the Khashoggi killing had subsided. Talks about a share sale were revived shortly after.OIL PRICESThis year’s bond sale forced Aramco to disclose its financials, revealing a colossal net income of $111 billion, over a third bigger than the combined net income of the five super majors Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP, Chevron and Total.Even with such profits, one bank pitching for a role in a renewed listing plan has put Aramco’s value at $1.4-$1.5 trillion including SABIC, a source familiar with the matter said. The source close to Aramco described that as a more realistic valuation.Oil and gas companies are struggling to attract investor interest due to a weaker outlook for oil and deepening climate activism. The S&P Energy sector is up 2 percent so far this year, underperforming the broader market which is 15 percent higher.Even at $1.5 trillion, Aramco would be worth at least 50 percent more than the world’s most valuable companies - Microsoft with around $1 trillion, Apple and Amazon at around $900 billion each.A key factor in an oil company’s value is the expected oil price. Producers including Saudi Arabia, its OPEC colleagues and non-members like Russia have struggled to prop up the market this year by a supply-limiting pact, due to slowing demand and rising supplies from the United States and other producers.Brent crude is trading at $59 a barrel, down from the $70-$80 that OPEC and industry sources have said Saudi Arabia favors.“If you are absolutely sure of a high oil price it’s easier to have a high valuation, but prices are not that high and a very high oil price is not sustainable,” said the source close to Aramco.“Also, a lot depends on the integration of SABIC and how convincing that story is.”Before the IPO was put on hold, banks estimated Aramco’s value at $1.3 to $1.7 trillion, the source close to Aramco said.Another person, a source with an international bank, said banks’ estimates at that time were around $1.5 trillion with $1.7 trillion at the top.Saudi Aramco pumps about one in every 10 barrels of oil produced in the world and sees the downstream - oil refining and petrochemicals - as increasingly important to boost the profit it makes on each barrel. With the purchase of SABIC, it aims to become a global leader in chemicals, helping to diversify its revenues.The source with the international bank said efforts remained focused on achieving the $2 trillion value, and a second source close to Aramco said the company has been working on ways to boost its own value independently of the oil price.“They are looking at things like internal governance and how to extract value,” this second source said. “If they structure the SABIC integration properly, it will increase the value of the company.” (Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal and Davide Barbuscia; Editing by Carmel Crimmins)",pos

"DUBAI ⁠— Saudi Arabia’s full oil production capacity will be recovered by the end of November, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC on Wednesday.“By September we will be, in terms of production capacity, at 11.3 (million barrels per day), by end of November we will be at 12 million barrels per day (bdp), which is our maximum sustained capacity,” Nasser told CNBC’s Steve Sedgwick during the Oil & Money Conference in London. Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest exporter of oil.The OPEC kingpin has been pumping significantly below that 12 million bpd level as part of a coordinated agreement OPEC and non-OPEC producers to lower output and keep a floor under falling oil prices.Aramco’s revenues were not reduced in the wake of the attacks, Nasser noted, and put its October production figure at 9.9 million bpd.The CEO of the world’s largest oil company expressed his concern over an “absence of international resolve” against the perpetrators of September 14 drone and missile attacks on Aramco facilities that forced the company to shut down half of its production and sent crude prices up nearly 20%.“An absence of international resolve to take concrete action may embolden the attackers and indeed put the world’s energy security at greater risk,” Nasser said.The attacks had “no impact” on the planned public listing of the state oil giant, the CEO added, saying that if anything, they strengthened the company’s position with regard to the offering. The Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO), which has seen multiple delays since it was first suggested in 2016, would be the world’s largest.“We are ready whenever the shareholders decide it is the time to list,” Nasser said.Aramco is expected to file its IPO prospectus by the end of this month, according to reports.The kingdom reportedly plans to list 1% of Aramco on its local stock exchange, the Tadawul, before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020 as first steps ahead of a public sale of roughly 5% of the company. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has estimated the firm’s value at $2 trillion, while analysts put the figure closer to $1.5 trillion.The success of the IPO depends in part on the oil price, which is down some 30% in the last year, despite heightened geopolitical tensions in the Gulf region.Brent crude futures were trading at $58.78 a barrel on Wednesday morning at 11:15 a.m. London time, up nearly 1% from the previous day. Still, the international oil benchmark’s price is now lower than it was the day before the Aramco attacks, which Riyadh and Washington have blamed on Iran, a charge Tehran denies.There are “many factors” impacting the oil price today, Nasser told CNBC’s Sedgwick, noting that the global economic situation as a whole was affecting crude prices. “I think market was very satisfied with Saudi Aramco’s response (to the attacks), but also... there is a tariffs dispute ongoing between two super global economies. All of these things are impacting price of crude.”The CEO added that there is ample oil supply on the market, and that he expects demand to average at 1 million bpd.In earlier comments Wednesday, Nasser said that there was “no doubt” Iran was behind attacks on Saudi Arabia, which struck multiple points at two of Aramco’s largest facilities: Abqaiq, the largest crude oil processing and stabilization plant in the world, and Khurais, the kingdom’s second-largest oil field.Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have been at war with the Saudis since 2015 and are backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the strike, but numerous Western governments and security experts say the rebels could not have carried out such a sophisticated attack.In late September, ratings agency Fitch downgraded Saudi Arabia’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating from A+ to A, citing the “vulnerability of its economic infrastructure” and “deterioration in Saudi Arabia’s fiscal and external balance sheets.” Riyadh was quick to reject the downgrade, calling it “somewhat speculative.”The Aramco IPO is part of the kingdom’s Vision 2030, an initiative spearheaded by the 34-year-old crown prince to diversify the country’s economy and reduce its reliance on hydrocarbon revenues.",neg

"RIYADH/DUBAI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The Saudi central bank is vetting local lenders’ exposure to Saudi Aramco ahead of an initial public offering (IPO) of the state-oil giant that will likely see large numbers of Saudi investors seek loans to buy its stock, three sources familiar with the matter said.The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, or SAMA, contacted Saudi banks last week, asking them a series of questions about their lending exposure to Aramco, two of the sources said.Saudi investors are expected to be large buyers of Aramco shares, partly because of a “patriotic” push to own a piece of the kingdom’s crown jewels after an attack on oil facilities last month crippled Saudi crude production and exposed the country’s defense vulnerabilities.SAMA is checking whether local banks have the capacity to handle demand for loans linked to the IPO, one of the sources said. Up to 6-7 million local investors are expected to participate in the listing, he added, but it is not clear how many of them will use credit to finance their share purchases.The authority is assessing “risk weighting and wants to ensure there will be no (regulatory) breaches,” a second source said.The source said SAMA’s questions - via telephone and email - were around how banks classify their exposure to Aramco, including its subsidiaries.“Aramco has so much ownership in so many entities ... it’s hard to say how much exposure it comes to,” he said.The world’s most profitable company, Aramco dominates the local economy with over a dozen domestic subsidiaries in addition to partial ownership in joint ventures including power generation companies and large petrochemical firms such as Petro Rabigh.Saudi banks have been under pressure in the past few years from a slowdown in the construction and retail sectors, but “funding and liquidity remained sound, with deposit and loan growth roughly in line, and capital ratios solid,” Fitch rating agency said this summer.The central bank’s governor, Ahmed al-Kholifey, said last month that he did not expect the IPO to affect liquidity in the Saudi banking sector, but that SAMA may revise its lending regulations to facilitate availability of liquidity to investors before the IPO.SAMA and Aramco did not respond to requests for comment.PRESSING AHEADSaudi Arabia is pressing ahead with plans to sell between 1% and 2% of its oil company, the world’s largest, through a local listing, which might be followed by additional share sales locally and internationally.Aramco has approached wealthy Saudi families in recent weeks as part of wider efforts to build a large investor base to achieve the $2 trillion valuation targeted by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, two sources previously told Reuters.The local listing  crucial to Prince Mohammed’s plans to wean the Saudi economy off its oil dependence  could raise more than $20 billion in its initial phase.Aramco has been meeting analysts over the past few weeks to market the company ahead of the listing. Analysts’ reports are expected to be released on Oct. 20.The company’s main advisers last week started pre-IPO meetings with potential investors in the United States, Europe and Asia, to gauge demand for the deal, two sources said.An IPO prospectus in Arabic could be released to investors on Oct. 25 and an English one for the wider market on Oct. 27, the sources said.This week, Fitch downgraded Aramco by one notch to an ‘A’ credit rating, citing last month’s attacks and rising geopolitical tensions in the region.Riyadh has blamed adversary Iran for the attacks, a charge Tehran denies.Aramco’s bonds fell after the rating announcement, which was widely expected as it followed a similar downgrade of the sovereign on Sept. 30.

"JessopLONDON/DUBAI, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco’s biggest asset could also be a liability.The state energy giant’s vast oil reserves  it can sustain current production levels for the next 50 years  make it more exposed than any other company to a rising tide of environmental activism and shift away from fossil fuels.In the three years since Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman first proposed a stock market listing, climate change and new green technologies are putting some investors, particularly in Europe and the United States, off the oil and gas sector.Sustainable investments account for more than a quarter of all assets under management globally, by some estimates.Aramco, for its part, argues oil and gas will remain at the heart of the energy mix for decades, saying renewables and nuclear cannot meet rising global demand, and that its crude production has lower greenhouse gas emissions than its rivals.But with the company talking again to banks about an initial public offering (IPO), some investors and lawyers say the window to execute a sale at a juicy price is shrinking and Aramco will need to explain to prospective shareholders how it plans to profit in a lower-carbon world.“Saudi Aramco is a really interesting test as to whether the market is getting serious about pricing in energy transition risk,” said Natasha Landell-Mills, in charge of integrating environment, social and governance (ESG) considerations into investing at London-based asset manager Sarasin & Partners.“The longer that (the IPO) gets delayed, the less willing the market will be to price it favorably because gradually investors are going to need to ask questions about how valuable those reserves are in a world that is trying to get down to net zero emissions by 2050.”Reuters reported on Aug. 8 that Prince Mohammed was insisting on a $2 trillion valuation even though some bankers and company insiders say the kingdom should trim its target to around $1.5 trillion.A valuation gap could hinder any share sale. The IPO was previously slated for 2017 or 2018 and, when that deadline slipped, to 2020-2021.Aramco told Reuters it was ready for a listing and the timing would be decided by the government.The company also said it was investing in research to make cars more efficient, and working on new technologies to use hydrogen in cars, convert more crude to chemicals and capture CO2 which can be injected in its reservoirs to improve extraction of oil.SELLING THE STORYSome would argue this is not enough.A growing number of investors across the world are factoring ESG risk into their decision-making, although the degree to which that would stop them investing in Aramco varies wildly.Some would exclude the company on principle because of its carbon output, while others would be prepared to buy if the price was cheap enough to outweigh the perceived ESG risk - especially given oil companies often pay healthy dividends.For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2MS62mf.At a $1.5 trillion valuation, Aramco would be the world’s largest public company. If it were included in major equity indices it would automatically be bought by passive investment funds that track them, regardless of their ESG credentials.And as the world’s most profitable company, Aramco shares would be snapped up by many active investors.Talks about a share sale were revived this year after Aramco attracted huge investor demand for its first international bond issue. In its bond prospectus, it said climate change could potentially have a “material adverse effect” on its business.When it comes to an IPO, equity investors require more information about potential risks and how companies plan to deal with them, as they are more exposed than bondholders if a business runs into trouble.“Companies need to lead with the answers in the prospectus, rather than have two or three paragraphs describing potential risks from environmental issues,” said Nick O’Donnell, partner in the corporate department at law firm Baker McKenzie.“An oil and gas company needs to be thinking about how to explain the story over the next 20 years and bring it out into a separate section rather than hiding it away in the prospectus, it needs to use it as a selling tool. And also, once the IPO is done, every annual report should have a standalone ESG section.”Unlike other major oil companies, Aramco doesn’t have a separate report laying out how it addresses ESG issues such as labor practices and resource scarcity, while it does not publish the carbon emissions from products it sells. Until this year’s bond issue, it also kept its finances under wraps.The company does however have an Environmental Protection Department, sponsors sustainability initiatives and is a founding member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, which is led by 13 top energy companies and aims to cut emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.On Aug. 12 Aramco published information on the intensity of its hydrocarbon mix for the first time. It disclosed the amount of greenhouse gases from each barrel it produces.Aramco’s senior vice president of finance Khalid al-Dabbagh said during an earnings call this month that its carbon emissions from “upstream” exploration and production were the lowest among its peers.A study published by Science magazine last year found carbon emissions from Saudi Arabia’s crude production were the world’s second lowest after Denmark, as a result of having a small number of highly productive oilfields.THE OIL PRICEAramco says that, with the global economy forecast to double in size by 2050, oil and gas will remain essential.“Saudi Aramco is determined to not only meet the world’s growing demand for ample, reliable and affordable energy but to meet the world’s growing demand for much cleaner fuel,” it told Reuters.“Alternatives are still facing significant technological, economic and infrastructure hurdles, and the history of past energy transitions shows that these developments take time.”The company has also moved to diversify into gas and chemicals and is using renewable energy in its facilities.But Aramco still, ultimately, represents a bet on the price of oil.It generated net income of $111 billion in 2018, over a third more than the combined total of the five “super-majors” ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron and Total.In 2016, when the oil price hit 13-year lows, Aramco’s net income was only $13 billion, according to its bond prospectus where it unveiled its finances for the first time, based on current exchange rates. Its earnings fell 12% in the first half of 2019, mainly on lower oil prices.Concerns about future demand for fossil fuels have weighed on the sector. Since 2016, when Prince Mohammed first flagged an IPO, the 12-months forward price to earnings ratio of five of the world’s top listed oil companies has fallen to 12 from 21 on average, according to Reuters calculations, lagging the FTSE 100 and the STOXX Europe 600 Oil & Gas index averages.For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2YCvfYY.By comparison, UK-listed funds investing in renewable energy infrastructure such as wind farms are trading at one of the biggest average premiums to net asset value.For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2YD6n3y.AN INFLUX OF CAPITALUsing a broad measure, there was global sustainable investment of $30.1 trillion across the world’s five major markets at the end of 2018, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Review http://www.gsi-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GSIRtReview2018F.pdf, more than a quarter of all assets under management globally. That compares with $22.8 trillion in 2016.For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2MKcZGa.For an interactive version of the graphic, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2YCZTl0.“Given the influx of capital into the ESG space, Aramco’s IPO would have been better off going public 5-10 years ago,” said Joseph di Virgilio, global equities portfolio manager at New York-based Romulus Asset Management, which has $900 million in assets under management.“An IPO today would still be the largest of its kind, but many asset managers focusing solely on ESG may not participate.”The world’s top listed oil and gas companies have come under heavy pressure from investors and climate groups in recent years to outline strategies to reduce their carbon footprint.Shell, BP and others have agreed, together with shareholders, on carbon reduction targets for some of operations and to increase spending on renewable energies. U.S. major ExxonMobil, the world’s top publicly traded oil and gas company, has resisted adopting targets.Britain’s biggest asset manager LGIM removed Exxon from its 5 billion pounds ($6.3 billion) Future World funds for what it said was a failure to confront threats posed by climate change. LGIM did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would buy shares in Aramco’s potential IPO.Sarasin & Partners said in July it had sold nearly 20% of its holdings in Shell, saying its spending plans were out of sync with international targets to battle climate change. The rest of the stake is under review.The asset manager, which has nearly 14 billion pounds in assets under management, didn’t participate in Aramco’s bond offering and Landell-Mills said they would be unlikely to invest in any IPO.(Additional reporting by Ron Bousso in London and Victoria Klesty in Oslo; Editing by Carmel Crimmins and Pravin Char)",pos

"listing@* Aramco ready for listing outside Saudi Arabia - CEO* Saudi Arabia will be primary listing, CEO says* IPO is planned for 2020-2021, but could be by end-2019 (Adds analysts, details on investors concerns)ABU DHABI/RIYADH, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is primed to float on international markets to complement a planned primary listing at home, the Saudi Arabian oil giant’s chief executive said on Tuesday.Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO) would happen “very soon,” Amin Nasser cited Saudi Arabia’s new energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman as saying, adding that the final decision on the venue and timing rested with the government.“We have always said that Aramco is ready whenever the shareholder makes a decision to list ... so we are prepared, that’s the bottom line,” Nasser told reporters, adding:“It is going to be the primary listing, to list locally, but we are ready also for listing outside in other jurisdictions.”Saudi Arabia, which has long planned an international IPO of Aramco, now plans a gradual listing of the world’s top oil producing company on its home market, sources familiar with the matter said. The IPO is planned for 2020-2021, but could happen by the end of this year.Aramco’s board last month decided that listing in New York, an option favored by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, would carry too many legal risks, sources told Reuters. He had hoped Aramco would be valued at $2 trillion, before plans for the IPO were put on hold last year, the sources said.London, Hong Kong and Tokyo have also been keen to woo Saudi officials to trade shares in Aramco on their exchanges.The flotation, which could be the world’s biggest IPO, is crucial for Crown Prince Mohammed’s plans to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil revenues.The IPO plan has rapidly gained momentum in recent days and Nasser welcomed the appointment this month of the head of the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund PIF as Aramco’s new chairman, Yasser al-Rumayyan, saying he brought “a lot of riches.”Rumayyan, a close ally of Crown Prince Mohammed, took over from former energy minister Khalid al-Falih in a move to separate Aramco from the ministry, a step Saudi officials have said was important to pave the way for the IPO.The separation aimed to ease transparency concerns, but some investors remain wary of Riyadh’s continued control.Rumayyan’s position as head of the PIF, the body tasked with delivering Crown Prince Mohammed’s economic transformation plan, means a close link with the government persists.Aramco has this year taken steps to address misgivings over transparency, including revenue flows, by opening its books for the first time to obtain a public credit rating ahead of its debut bond. But an international IPO would garner more scrutiny, including over dividend payments.“For bond investors its different, but for potential IPO investors a central consideration is being minority shareholders in a company so closely linked to the governments strategies,” said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.While some investors welcomed Rumayyan’s appointment as a “positive” step, others said it did not dispel concerns over governance given the economy’s heavy reliance on oil.“There seems to be more of an alignment between the sovereign wealth fund, Saudi economic policies and Aramco`s potential new role there. This link is what ... we need to be monitoring carefully,” Sergey Dergachev, a manager of emerging market corporate debt at Germany-based Union Investment, said.Nasser said Aramco would have an “arms-length” relationship with the energy ministry with the appointment of oil veteran Prince Abdulaziz as energy minister.“The guidelines for production are going to come from the ministry, there is no change when it comes to production targets or maximum sustained capacity,” Nasser addedCLEANER ENERGYNasser told the World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi that oil and gas will remain at the heart of the global energy mix for decades to come and that Aramco was also taking steps to meet the climate challenges.“We have heard loud and clear the call from stakeholders and society at large for cleaner energy. The world faces an incredible climate challenge and we need a bold response to match,” Nasser said.Aramco’s upstream carbon intensity is one of the world’s lowest, at about 10 kilograms of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent, and based on third party verification of greenhouse gas emissions, its methane intensity in 2018 was 0.06% - one of the lowest in the industry, Nasser said.Since Crown Prince Mohammed first proposed a stock market listing in 2016, climate change and new green technologies are putting some investors, particularly in Europe and the United States, off the oil and gas sector.Nasser said Aramco was investing in technologies to make car engines more efficient with lower emissions, to use hydrogen fuels, convert more crude to chemicals and capturing CO2 which can be later injected into oil reservoirs.He also criticized policies that do not appear to consider the long-term nature of the oil and gas business.“We have already seen the impact of what I call a ‘Crisis of Perception’ on long-term investment, and if it continues supply shortfalls will follow as night follows day,” Nasser said.“That would hurt the competitiveness of national economies, threaten their energy security, and potentially create social disruption - by making energy less affordable. The world can no longer afford such policy miscalculations.” (Reporting by Rania El Gamal, Dahlia Nehme, Alex Cornwell; Writing by Tuqa Khalid and Ghaida Ghantous; Editing by Tom Hogue, Louise Heavens and Alexander Smith)",pos

"(Adds Aramco’s no comment)LONDON/DUBAI, July 18 (Reuters) - Boutique investment bank Evercore Partners has lost the chance to retain a prime position as an independent advisor for Saudi Aramco’s potential $100 billion share sale, as the oil giant revives its postponed listing, three sources said.The Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih, who also chairs Aramco, said earlier in July the long-awaited listing could happen in 2020-2021.Evercore, founded and chaired by U.S. banker and former politician Roger Altman, had secured an equity advisory role with the oil giant in 2017 for what is expected to be the world’s largest ever initial public offering (IPO).But the relationship between Evercore and Aramco deteriorated, making it difficult for the U.S. advisor to get a new top role, the sources said.One of the sources also said that the appeal of Aramco’s IPO to Evercore had diminished, due to the relatively low level of fees involved.An Evercore spokesman declined to comment.Work on the IPO was interrupted in 2018 when Aramco shifted its attention to the acquisition of a 70% stake in local petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp.Banks were dismissed, meaning that when the process re-starts they will have to make fresh pitches to the company, two other sources said.Aramco is expected to formally approach banks for bookrunner roles over the next few weeks, they added.Alongside Evercore, Aramco chose Moelis & Co and U.S. dealmaker Michael Klein as independent advisors, while JPMorgan , Morgan Stanley and HSBC Holdings Plc were among those to secure leading roles in the IPO.HSBC, which was chosen as a global coordinator, could now end up with a more marginal role, two of the sources said.HSBC and Saudi Aramco declined to comment.NO CHOICEAlthough Saudi Aramco is known for having paid relatively low banking fees in the past, banks competed fiercely for an IPO mandate in late 2016 because it was viewed as a gateway to other deals expected to emerge from Saudi Arabia’s privatisation plan.“International banks feel that they have no choice...they will again send senior teams to Saudi Arabia to pitch, work and hopefully execute the deal,” one of the sources said.Evercore has pushed to win advisory roles in the Middle East, opening an office in Dubai in 2017 and advising Saudi Arabia’s Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), on acquiring an equity interest in AccorInvest, a subsidiary of AccorHotels for 4.4 billion euros ($4.94 billion) in 2018.It also advised the PIF on its $1 billion investment in electric car maker Lucid Motors, according to sources.Aramco’s IPO is the centrepiece of a Saudi Arabian government plan to transform the economy by attracting foreign investment and diversifying away from oil.Its gestation has however been complicated by scepticism about Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s public declaration in 2016 that the sale would value the company at $2 trillion. There are also concerns about the legal risks and tough disclosure requirements associated with a foreign listing.

JPMORGAN CHASE CLOSE TO WINNING LEAD ADVISORY ROLE FOR SAUDI ARAMCO IPO - SOURCE,pos
"The success of Saudi Aramco’s debt offering has given Saudi officials confidence that they can bring their IPO to market sometime in 2020, sources familiar with their thinking said.Saudi Aramco’s board was meeting with bankers in Boston this week, and the IPO of the world’s biggest oil company was on the agenda. Recently, Saudi energy minister Khalid Al-Falih said Aramco would likely go public in 2020, 2021. One source suggested the company is trying to move the timeline forward, with an announcement in the fall and the offering of a small percentage of Aramco next year.Aramco is expected to hold an investor call Monday, its first ever following its board meeting. It is expected bond investors will be on the call, and it is not clear which company officials will speak and what they will say about the stock offering, or whether they will take questions.Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had planned the public offering of Aramco to be the cornerstone of his vision to transform the kingdom from an oil producer to a more diversified economy. But it was put off previously, and Aramco reached a $69.1 billion deal to purchase a majority stake in petrochemicals firm Sabic from the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, boosting the fund’s buying power and ability to diversify holdings.MBS, as the crown prince is known, is seeking a $2 trillion valuation for Saudi Aramco, but there still seems to be a gap between what the prince would like to see and what bankers view as a reasonable market price, given the wild cards of oil prices, stock prices and the global economy. The bankers’ valuations average around $1.5 trillion, one source said.“It’s going to be a lot harder job to get there, especially since going into 2020 doesn’t look fantastic for oil prices,” said one source. But the company may show strong cash flow to help make its case.“It’s clear the 10 fold over-subscription for the debt gave a giant burst of confidence to doing an IPO,” said one source. “But there’s a big difference between a debt offering and reporting quarterly performance to shareholders around the world.”Saudi Aramco issued $12 billion in bonds in April in an offering that saw sky-high demand of $100 billion.A report that Saudi Arabia called other producers to discuss how to support oil prices helped kick up crude prices Thursday after its steep decline. Brent futures were trading at $57.47 per barrel, and it is down 11.7% month-to-date. One source dismissed that report as unlikely, based on the fact that OPEC is currently producing about 2 million barrels a day beneath its quota and cutting further would be futile.Saudi Arabia earlier announced that demand for its oil was improved, with a 700,000 barrel per day increase in customer request for supply for September, over August.“Obviously, it’s the latest round of verbal intervention by the Saudis to try to push back against the narrative that the demand growth outlook is cratering for the oil market,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital.",neg
"(Adds details and background)DUBAI, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant Saudi Aramco plans to pay a base dividend of $75 billion in 2020, it said in a corporate overview posted to its website on Monday as it prepares for an initial public offering (IPO).Aramco has been courting investors for the IPO, for which it seeks to achieve a $2 trillion valuation.The document said the company would have “a progressive growing dividend on sustainable basis at board discretion.”The listing of Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to shake up the Saudi economy and diversify away from oil. The IPO appears to be proceeding despite uncertainty over the timeline following a Sept. 14 attack on Aramco’s facilities.The document on Monday also mentioned the company’s “progressive royalty scheme,” with a marginal rate set at 15% up to $70 per barrel, 45% between $70 and $100, and 80% if the price rises higher.(Writing by Nafisa Eltahir and Lisa Barrington; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and David Evans)",neg
"OPEC and Russia are likely to extend their oil production deal at least through midyear, but if they were to cut more output, as some speculate, it would blindside what has become a complacent market, analysts said.The ministers head into the Dec. 5 and 6 meeting with oil prices near their highest levels in two months. OPEC and Russia and other allies have an ongoing agreement to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels a day, with the biggest cuts coming from Saudi Arabia.“At this stage, it’s not perfect for a number of producers, but it’s not catastrophic either,” said Helima Croft, global head of commodities strategy at RBC. “We’re kind of treading water.” The current agreement expires in March, but many analysts expect the OPEC plus group to extend it until its next meeting in June or even to its meeting a year from now.“It’s a very unsettled time for OPEC. The gulf between the haves and have nots has widened. Price relief has not been enough to stave off social unrest in a number of key producer states. ... There’s no better option at this point,” Croft said. ”...We’ve had almost like a second Arab spring.”Croft expects the deal to be extended until June, and then ministers will again review it. Many other analysts expect the cuts will be extended as well, but some believe OPEC and Russia could cut even more.“A Hollywood shock ending would be if they actually went deeper,” Croft said.The meeting comes at a key time for Saudi Arabia, which will be issuing stock in its state-run Saudi Aramco for the first time ever, just as OPEC’s meeting gets underway.“It wouldn’t surprise me if the Saudis would go for more [production cuts], to tighten the market even more than they have already,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital. Kilduff said Saudi Arabia may want to make sure oil prices continue to improve, especially in light of the Aramco offering.Russian energy minister Alexander Novak has said he doesn’t favor increasing the size of the cuts, and the Russian position is that members should be forced to comply with the current level of production.Russia has also been angling to have condensates removed from the deal, meaning it would only to have its actual crude oil production counted, not other petroleum byproducts. If that were to happen, Russia’s share of the cuts would fall since its overall production total would drop.“The Russian intentions will be a critical aspect of it for the future, especially with them wanting some wiggle room on the condensate and potentially produce more. They’ll be in the deal in name only,” said Kilduff.There has been speculation that Russia may be unhappy with the production agreement, in part because its energy companies oppose it.“It’s not so much that Russia is going to storm out of the meeting. As to what may end up happening, may be more wait and see,” said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee. He said it’s possible the OPEC plus group could maintain the status quo, hold off on extending the agreement, and call a meeting for right before the March expiration. That would unsettle the market, he said.″“Unless they deliver something quite strong and stick to it, then it’s more likely to have some downside risk,” he said.Lee said it’s even possible Russia and Saudi Arabia could ultimately break off their agreement, and it may have been ended already were it not for Russia’s problems with contaminated oil earlier this year. The incident forced it to reduce exports, and it came into compliance with the accord.But most analysts say the agreement has support from President Vladimir Putin and that’s what matters most.“He’s the new sultan of oil,” said Kilduff. Even Putin mentioned the Aramco IPO when discussing OPEC recently in Brazil.“We have really constructive dialogue with OPEC,” Putin was quoted as saying. “We understand that the tough stance, including from our friends from Saudi Arabia, is linked to the Saudi Aramco IPO. Everybody understands this. It’s an open secret.”Russian energy companies are set to meet with Novak later in the week. “It helps Russia’s bargaining position if Novak goes into the meeting and says he has a coalition of producers who don’t like the cuts,” she said.Croft said the Russian relationship with OPEC, or Saudi Arabia, is important, and Putin supports the arrangement so Russia will be behind maintaining an agreement.“I think the financial benefits and the soft power strategic gains far outweigh the cost of shutting down several hundred thousand barrels,” said Croft. “The broader Russia Inc has gained enormously in terms of new deals that have been signed with Saudi Arabia and the UAE...The ultimate decision maker is Vladimir Putin and the deal provided significant dividends.”Kilduff said oil prices could go higher because currently the market is ignoring turmoil in the Middle East and is mostly focused on the trade talks between the U.S. and China.Croft noted that protests in Iraq, near energy operations in Basra, could impact oil output if energy workers got involved. There has been unrest across the Middle East, including in Iran, where protests against the government are increasing as the economy worsens and Tehran cut gasoline subsidies.“The futures market is signalling that the market is tightly supplied at the moment,” said Kilduff.

"Aramco IPO@ (Adds quotes, details)MOSCOW, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has fully restored oil output after attacks on its facilities last month and is now focused on the listing of state oil giant Saudi Aramco, its energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Thursday.The kingdom's crude oil production capacity is now 11.3 million barrels per day, he said, adding that the attacks, which halved the crude output of the world's top exporter, were an attempt to ruin Saudi Arabia's reputation as ""a reliable, secure and dependable oil supplier.""""We all rose to the challenge,"" he told a Moscow energy conference.The Sept. 14 attacks targeted the Abqaiq and the Khurais oil plants, causing a spike in oil prices, fires and damage and shutting down 5.7 million bpd of production, or more than 5% of global oil supply.Saudi Arabia has managed to maintain supplies to customers at levels before the attacks by drawing from its huge oil inventories and offering other crude grades from other fields, Saudi officials have said.""We have stabilized production capacity, we are at 11.3 (million bpd)... We still have the kit and the tools to overcome any future challenges,"" Prince Abdulaziz said.One of challenges for the kingdom now was the listing of Aramco, a centerpiece of Saudi Arabia's plans to reform its economy and diversify away from oil, he added.""We want to make sure that it is the most successful IPO,"" he said, adding that the kingdom is working on diversifying its energy resources and adding both renewables and nuclear power.""As far as I am concerned... we moved on, we flipped the page and (are) rising up to the new challenge,"" he said.Bankers from around 20 international and domestic financial institutions are now working a plan to sell about 1-2% of Aramco by 2020-2021 in Riyadh, before an international listing, sources have told Reuters.Prince Abdulaziz, a veteran oil official and a son of the king, was last month named as the kingdom's energy minister.

"A change of leadership at oil giant Saudi Aramco and its delayed initial public offering (IPO) is not a concern, the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund (RDIF) told CNBC Wednesday.″(Saudi) Aramco is one of the greatest companies in the world and the market is waiting for this IPO to happen. And frankly it’s going to give a very important boost to the Saudi economy that’s transforming itself,” Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of RDIF, told CNBC’s Tanvir Gill.“We believe Aramco is a great investment opportunity, I think it will generate a lot of interest from Asian investors, from investors all over the world. Oil is here to stay for a long time and there are many players who would be interested to invest in the Aramco IPO,” Dmitriev added.Dmitriev is attending the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok where Russian President Vladimir Putin is hosting the leaders of Japan, India and Malaysia. Dmitriev said earlier Wednesday that Russia plans to expand its cooperation with Saudi Arabia and would make joint investments with Aramco, Reuters reported.RDIF, Russia’s $10 billion sovereign wealth fund, already has investment partnerships with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth funds, PIF and SAGIA.  Saudi Aramco has made moves to invest in Russia’s energy industry, with the two companies agreeing terms of an investment into Russian oilfield services firm Novomet earlier this year. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih also reportedly told Putin at an economic forum back in June that Aramco plans to invest in Russia. Dmitriev’s vote of confidence in Saudi Arabia and Aramco comes after it announced it was replacing the company’s chairman, al-Falih, with the head of its sovereign wealth fund, Yasir Bin Othman Al-Rumayyan. The move has come amid criticism of the company’s slow progress toward an IPO, first announced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2016.The sale of roughly 5% of Aramco is expected to value the company at $1 to $2 trillion, making it the largest initial public offering ever.  It plans to list first on the Saudi stock exchange before an international listing.The planned IPO date has been pushed back from an initial plan to launch in 2018 as Saudi Arabia has been waiting for optimum conditions to list amid an uncertain oil price environment. It is now mooted for 2020 or 2021.Oil prices have risen since a massive decline in mid-2014 due to a glut in supply. Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the largest global oil producers, have since led a pact to reduce supply in a bid to stabilize oil prices.Dmitriev called the pact, between OPEC and non-OPEC producer Russia, a “great deal.”“We have a great deal with Saudi Arabia that has stabilized oil markets, we saw that the oil price is stable in the $60-$70 range and definitely there is growing demand and actually the U.S. inventory has been declining,” he said.Russia’s Eastern Economic Forum comes as Russia looks to pivot investment to Asia, amid U.S. and European sanctions placed on it for the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and its role in a pro-Russian uprising in east Ukraine.",pos
"DUBAI, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco said on Wednesday it was joining the World Bank’s initiative to reduce gas flaring to zero by 2030 and said its flaring was already less than 1% of its total raw gas production in the first half of 2019.Aramco kick-started its initial public offering (IPO) this week, announcing its intention to float on the domestic bourse in what could be the worlds biggest listing, planned for later this year.The World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring initiative aims to reduce wasteful burning of natural gas at production fields, and to reduce emissions of hydrofluorocarbon (HFCs), industrial gases with a high potential to trap the earths heat.“We are also investing in advanced technologies to enable greater efficiency and lower emissions in transport, carbon-free hydrogen fuels, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS),” Ahmad al-Saadi, Aramco’s senior vice president for technical services, said in the statement.“This is all part of our broader effort to enable the circular carbon economy and deliver clean, reliable and affordable energy to the world while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions,” he said.Aramco’s vast oil reserves, which mean it can sustain current production levels for the next 50 years, make it more exposed than other companies to a rising tide of environmental activism and shift away from fossil fuels.

"DUBAI ⁠— An attack that knocked out half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production capacity has cast a shadow over state-owned oil giant Aramco and its long-awaited initial public offering, poised to be the largest in history.Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told the media just last week that the mammoth company would list on the Riyadh stock exchange “very soon” as bankers from J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Citigroup met in Dubai to kick-start work on the gigantic offering.News of the weekend attack sent money streaming into safe haven assets Monday morning, and industry experts questioned the security of Aramco’s assets and the confidence of its future shareholders.“Saturday’s attacks raise the fear of future attacks in a very real way for equities investors,” Ellen Wald, president of Transversal Consulting and author of the book “Saudi, Inc.” told CNBC via email Sunday.“Those familiar with the company know that Aramco has been prepared for this for a very long time, but it likely is not something already priced into the opinions of the typical fund.”Riyadh has not offered a timeline for the recovery of all of Aramco’s production capacity, a central factor to the direction of oil prices. Sources close to the firm say it could take anywhere from days or weeks to months. The strikes, which have been claimed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, but which some U.S. officials blame on Iran, took out roughly 5.7 million barrels per day of Saudi oil production — equivalent to 5% of global daily crude output.A key question for investors is whether the schedule for the IPO will go ahead as planned, which according to some reports had put the Riyadh listing date as early as November.“We will have to see if the Saudi monarchy chooses to delay the IPO as it focuses on this attack and the aftermath,” Wald said. Saudi Aramco has not spoken on the matter and did not reply to CNBC requests for comment. Neither did Moelis & Co., the firm hired to advise it.Like its energy infrastructure, the kingdom’s markets are far from immune — Riyadh’s stock exchange, the Tadawul, suffered a 2.3% drop as it opened on Sunday morning.“Saudi Arabia should carefully consider what impact a future attack on a publicly listed Aramco could have on its stock exchange,” Wald warned.Ayham Kamel, Middle East practice head at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, doesn’t foresee alterations ahead in the leadership’s plans.“Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will push the company to demonstrate that it can effectively tackle terrorism or war challenges,” Kamel wrote in a client note Sunday, while noting that geopolitical risks have not been adequately priced into valuation estimates for the company and its assets.The attack on Aramco’s installations in Abqaiq and Khurais “will have only a limited impact on interest in Aramco shares as the first stage of the IPO will be local,” Kamel said. However, he added, “the international component of the sale would be more sensitive to geopolitical risks.”Reuters reported last week that the kingdom plans to list 1% of Aramco on its local stock exchange before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020, as first steps ahead of a public sale of roughly 5% of the company.The oil giant has delayed its IPO, originally scheduled for 2018, reportedly over Saudi concerns about public scrutiny of its finances and because of the complexity of its corporate structure. Crown Prince Mohammed has touted a valuation of as high as $2 trillion, while a number of bankers recommend a figure closer to $1.5 trillion. The oil price will be key to this.“Saturday’s incidents exposed an Achilles Heel in the ability to defend a very important segment of oil infrastructure,” Samir Madani, co-founder of data firm Tankertrackers.com, said Sunday.“If customers aren’t duly addressed with the volumes they ordered, it will reflect poorly for a company that is lining itself up for a gigantic IPO. Shareholders want to see volumes regardless of price. Shipments will naturally be addressed by storage draws, but the question is for how long given the variety of oil grades that need to be exported.”While markets await word from the Saudis, investors are likely asking themselves how the kingdom could have left itself so vulnerable, and what that means for the future.“Saudi Arabia has always said their oil installations are safe. Suddenly that’s no longer the case,” Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects, told CNBC on Monday. “Some production could come back quickly, some could take months.”",pos
"(Adds dateline, minister’s comments, changes sourcing)LONDON/DUBAI, July 2 (Reuters) - Investment banks are scrambling to re-pitch to advise Saudi Aramco on a possible initial public offering, sources familiar with the matter said, with Saudi Arabia’s energy minister confirming plans for the listing to proceed in 2020 or 2021.“Bankers previously involved in the IPO are pushing for meetings with Aramco,” one of the sources said.“There is some shifting in terms of what roles the banks might have if IPO talks go ahead.”JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC were picked to play a leading role in the world’s biggest ever IPO when the plan was first announced in 2016.Boutique investment banks Moelis & Co and Evercore were also hired by Aramco as independent advisers.But plans for a domestic and international listing were later postponed.The Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih, who also chairs Aramco, said on Tuesday the company was ready to start working on the long-awaited listing, adding it could happen in 2020-2021.“The IPO process was never fully suspended,” al-Falih said.“We have always been clear that the IPO will happen in the 2020-2021 timeframe. We have never stopped talking about the IPO.”Al-Falih pointed to Aramco’s $69.1 billion acquisition of a 70 percent stake in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) along with a recent $12 billion bonds sale as the main reason for the IPO delay.“Now that all of these issues have been cleared, we are ready to start planning for the IPO,” he said.Al-Falih confirmed the same timeline that Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MbS, provided on June 16 when he said the government remained fully committed to the IPO project, expecting it to take place between 2020 and early 2021.MbS’s comments triggered a series of approaches by international investment banks who wanted to be in the driving seat, one of the sources said.The IPO is a centerpiece of the crown prince’s plan to diversify the kingdom’s economy beyond oil.“It is a catch 22 situation,” another source said. “After the statement by the Crown Prince, banks have been rushing to Aramco to pitch.”As part of their client coverage, investment banks frequently discuss listing options with Aramco, but no formal IPO process is underway, a third source said.Bloomberg earlier reported on Tuesday that Saudi Aramco recently held talks with a group of investment banks to discuss roles in its potential initial public offering, citing people familiar with the matter.

"Saudi Arabia’s new energy minister is expected to be fully behind the expedited IPO of the kingdom’s oil company, replacing a highly regarded minister whose downfall may be that he was too slow to embrace the Saudi Aramco offering and other reforms.Oil markets were surprised over the weekend when King Salman replaced Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih with his the monarch’s son Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, older half brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and minister of state for energy affairs since 2017.“The long tradition of the oil minister as a technocrat non-royal has been broken, and the best theory is that departing minister Khalid Al Falih was too resistant to the pace of change pursued by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman,” wrote Paul Sankey, energy analyst with Mizuho.Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said Tuesday the company is ready to list on the Saudi stock exchange “very soon” though he declined to say how much of Aramco would be listed on the Tadawul exchange or when the company would list internationally.Prince Abdulaziz, a respected energy official in his own right and former deputy energy minister, is just one of a half dozen Saudi energy ministers, going back to the early 1960s. The new minister was at the World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi on Monday, and he will be participating in a meeting there Thursday between OPEC and Russia on oil production.Abdulaziz made it clear Monday he will support the production cuts agreed to by the “OPEC plus” group. The cuts have largely been shouldered by Saudi Arabia, and while they did drive prices higher, some speculate, perhaps not high enough to help the IPO valuation.The public offering of Aramco has been seen as a cornerstone of the crown prince’s Vision 2030 plan to transform the Saudi economy and make it less dependent on fossil fuels. Sources say that Al-Falih was not always on the same page as the crown prince on some policy and did not fully embrace the public offering, which has recently been accelerated.Saudi’s crown prince is said to be looking for a $2 trillion valuation for Saudi Aramco, but some bankers have found the value to be closer to $1.5 trillion, according to industry sources. The gap in those valuations would narrow if oil prices were to rise.The appointment isn’t expected to have much impact on oil policy in the near term, but some analysts say the move consolidates control over the energy sector in the hands of the crown prince, who is known as MBS.“Abdulaziz bin Salman probably has no intention of changing Saudi Arabia’s oil stabilization policy for now. The production restraint policy and working with OPEC and Russia is key to Riyadh’s efforts to lift oil prices and generate more revenue for the state. It is also a key part of his brother’s plans to bolster the valuation of Aramco. The long-term oil market strategy is less certain given the changes in Saudi Arabia’s decision-making structure,” wrote Ayham Kamel, Eurasia Group practice head, Middle East & North Africa.Industry sources said Al-Falih may have become too powerful, with a rock star like persona in the energy world. He was an energy minister who had responsibility for broad policies, including OPEC production quotas. He was also chairman of Aramco, where he had his finger on the production operations, pricing and exports, until he was suddenly replaced in that position.The shakeup in the kingdom’s energy sector became more apparent last week, when Al-Falih was replaced by Yasir al-Rumayyan as chairman of Aramco. Al-Rumayyan is head of the Public Investment Fund, the country’s primary sovereign-wealth fund, which will invest the proceeds of the Aramco offering. Last month, the king had restructured the energy ministry by giving a new ministry oversight of some of its operations, including mining and industry.Al-Falih was also seen as hard-driving, a much different personality than Prince Abdulaziz, who has worked behind the scenes at OPEC gatherings and elsewhere.“He’s known as a consensus builder. I see him playing that role at OPEC,” said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC.The prince is also expected to stand behind his brother in pushing his reform agenda. “This team is absolutely in sync with the position of the crown prince. I think they’re absolutely in sync with his vision,” she said.Croft said the prince has been involved in renewable energy and in reducing energy intensity. “He’s championed the domestic energy reform agenda. It’s a very important effort domestically,” she said. “He’s given his life to the energy sector, to the ministry. He is the ultimate technocrat.”Al-Falih’s forceful personality was surely a benefit when he helped forge the relationship between OPEC and Russia and other non OPEC members. The collaboration did drive up prices, from depressed levels. As Saudi minister, Al-Falih had been the most closely watched and authoritative voice when it came to prices and production.Analysts said oil prices have been higher for the past two days as investors await the outcome of Thursday’s meeting of oil producers.Despite the production cuts, OPEC plus has not been able to consistently drive prices much higher because of increasing competition from the U.S. and other producers who keep adding oil to the world market. Brent crude futures gained $1.31, or 2.3%, to $62.58 a barrel Monday, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose $1.33, or 2.4%, to $57.85 a barrel. Brent is trading in a range it has been locked in since early August and is well off its 2019 high of more than $74 per barrel.Bank of America Merrill Lynch Middle East strategists said it appears there will be policy continuity, following the appointment. “Beyond the immediate-term, there could be potential for greater focus on supporting oil prices. However, global energy supply and demand dynamics remain challenging,” the strategists said. “The continuing Iran nuclear crisis may still eventually boost geopolitical risk premium.”The anticipated offering for 5% of Aramco would be the world’s largest initial public offering, and efforts have progressed to the point where J.P. Morgan could soon be named lead banker, sources told CNBC. The company is expected to follow this year’s local listing on the Tadawul exchange, with an international IPO next year, though no decision has been made on which exchange will host the listing, sources said.Kamel said the most important takeaway from the changes is that MBS appears to be “doubling down on his vision of transformation and diversification.”“Mohammad bin Salman has probably come to believe that the change momentum might have slowed down in the last 12 months. The personnel changes are only part of a broader set of changes designed to revive the vision,” he wrote.",pos
"ABU DHABI — New Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has underlined the importance of regulation for Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, as it gears up for a long-anticipated initial public offering (IPO).""I have no doubt in my mind that emphasizing the separation between Aramco, the corporate, and the ministry as regulator is a must,"" he told CNBC contributor Helima Croft at an audience of delegates at the 24th World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi Monday.""The regulator cannot be a person, the regulator has to be an institution.

The finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The committee reports directly to de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who wants to sell a 5% percent stake in Aramco as part of an ambitious plan to transform the economy of the world’s top oil exporter and wean it off crude revenues.The move is a significant indication that the kingdom is gearing up to fast-track a local listing of Aramco, by bringing in Rumayyan who has great experience with local IPOs at both government and private sectors.The past few days have seen Rumayyan replace Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih as Aramco chairman and Falih lose his seat on the company’s board as momentum builds to prepare for the sale.Falih said on Twitter that Rumayyan’s appointment was “an important step to prepare the company for the public offering.”The IPO, initially slated for 2017, has faced repeated delays. Saudi authorities say it is now slated for 2020 or 2021 and one source said Rumayyan pushed for that timeline.Rumayyan’s time as head of securities listing at the Saudi stock market regulator between 2004 and 2007 qualified him to take over the process from Jadaan, a veteran lawyer, another source told Reuters.The new Aramco chairman, a former investment banker, had also served on the board of the local stock exchange.The finance minister remains on the IPO executive committee, which also includes Economy Minister Mohammed al-Tuwaijri and royal court adviser Fahad Toonsi, two of the sources said.In August, sources told Reuters that the plan was for a domestic listing on the Riyadh bourse which would be followed by an international offering at a later stage.Aramco has already asked major banks to submit proposals for potential roles in the IPO, Reuters has reported..

EVERCORE PARTNERS SET TO LOSE TOP ADVISORY ROLE IN SAUDI ARAMCO’S IPO AS PREPARATION RESTARTS - SOURCES,pos
"Aramco’s hugely successful bond offering on Tuesday may be the final nail in the coffin for the Saudi oil giant’s much-anticipated and long-delayed stock market debut.Just three years ago, the Saudis cast the initial public offering for Aramco as the key to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious plan to diversify his nation’s oil-dependent economy. By offering investors the opportunity to own a piece of the world’s largest oil company, the kingdom hoped to raise $100 billion to seed investments in new industries and turn the petrostate into a technology and entertainment hub.Market watchers were already questioning the IPO after Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund struck a $69.1 billion deal last month to sell Aramco its 70% stake in petrochemicals giant Sabic. Aramco’s first-ever bond offering only raised further doubts about the need to go public.Seeking to raise $10 billion in its first debt sale, Aramco attracted more than $100 billion in bids from bond investors. While the bond offering will reportedly fund a portion of the Sabic acquisition, it also suggested there is plenty of appetite for future debt sales.“To the degree to which the goal of the IPO was seen as providing more funding for the Public Investment Fund ... if you can do this with a bond offering, the question is do you need an IPO?” said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, referring to the Saudi sovereign wealth fund.To be sure, the IPO is still seen as a priority for Prince Mohammed, and Saudi officials maintain that it will happen sometime in 2021. But the bond offering proves the kingdom can tap capital markets without the headache of an IPO.Despite being announced in January 2016, the Saudi government has yet to make key decisions, including where to list shares. Listing on a U.S. stock exchange could be perilous because it would expose the kingdom to lawsuits over its alleged role in the Sept.11, 2001, terror attacks in New York and Washington.The indecision is also reportedly due in part to transparency requirements that would force Aramco to open its books to the world. While Aramco’s bond prospectus offered new details about its operations and financials, a stock offering is “a completely different ballgame,” said Roger Diwan, vice president for financial services at IHS Markit.Disclosure requirements for an IPO are much higher than for a bond offering. Diwan says it might not make much sense for Aramco to subject itself to that level of disclosure, particularly if the Saudis can raise money cheaply on the bond market.“What the Aramco bond offering shows you is you have an underleveraged giant that you can use to juice up your capital when you need it,” Diwan said.In order to attract investors, Aramco would also have to offer an attractive dividend yield on par with payouts from oil giants like Exxon Mobil and BP. Those dividend yields range from about 4% to 6%.In comparison, the Aramco bonds were trading roughly 1.25 basis points above the 10-year Treasury yield at 2.489%. That means Aramco’s payouts to potential shareholders could be higher than what it needs to offer debt investors.Analysts also caution that the scramble for Aramco debt is not a direct indication of interest in owning the company’s shares. Debt investors are typically more passive than shareholders, who have greater say in how the company is run.Investing in Aramco equity could create thorny questions for big investors, who must answer to their own shareholders, Diwan said. Those shareholders could push institutional investors to pressure Aramco to disclose the impact of climate change on its operations or to improve environmental, social and governance standards.Shareholders may also ditch investors who purchase Aramco stock due to lingering outrage over the killing of dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.“The shareholders of those big institutional asset managers who own Aramco, at least in the West, would have a lot of political questions,” Diwan said. “That is not the same on the debt.”Michael Bradley, managing director for energy strategy at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, says Tuesday’s bond issuance could allow the IPO to be pushed back because there is no rush to raise cash. However, he believes it ultimately creates a much smoother path to the stock market debut.On the political side, the bond sale shows that investors will not be detracted by the Khashoggi killing, he said. Just six months ago, the conventional wisdom was that the incident left Saudi Arabia with little political capital and the kingdom would have to keep oil prices low to appease the Trump administration, Bradley noted.Instead, Saudi Arabia has slashed its output this year, helping to boost benchmark oil prices by 30-40% this year and reassuring investors of its influence over the market. The public disclosures in the bond prospectus have also put to bed some “nagging questions,” removing an element of uncertainty.“I personally think the public disclosures make the IPO much easier to float because a lot of info has been revealed which will help in the range of pricing when the deal is floated,” Bradley said in an email.“Bottom-line, the massively oversubscribed Aramco bond deal (way exceeded the most wild expectations) bodes well for the success of an eventual Aramco equity IPO.”",pos
"Saudi oil giant Aramco will be getting a new chairman to replace Energy Minister Khalid al Falih as the company moves ahead with its plans to go public.Falih had been spearheading the move towards an initial public offering but lately had been blamed for a slowing in the Saudi Arabian company’s movements towards diversification.Falih will be replaced by Yasser Othman Al-Rumayyan, governor of the Public Investment Fund, according to a tweet from Falih’s verified account. Falih congratulated Al-Rumayyan on the appointment, saying he was “wishing him every success,” according to a Google translation.The news comes just days after the Saudi government created a new ministry for industry and mineral resources, breaking it away from energy in a move seen as reducing Falih’s influence. However, he will remain the head of the energy ministry.The Wall Street Journal had reported that officials believe separating the duties will help accelerate the process to get the Aramco IPO moving ahead.A Saudi Aramco spokesman said the company would “respond at the earliest opportunity” to a CNBC request for comment.",pos
"Saudi Aramco’s CFO, in the company’s first-ever conference call, on Monday told investors that the company is ready to go public, but that the timing will be up to its owner, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.“Basically, the company is ready for the IPO. Now the timing of the IPO itself, this is a shareholder’s issue, and they will announce it depending on their perception of what would be the optimum market condition,” said Khalid al-Dabbagh, chief financial officer, reiterating the company’s previous stance.Sources have said that the Saudi government, encouraged by the success of Aramco’s $12 billion debt offering, would like to move its plans for the IPO forward, and issue stock in 2020. The offering is expected to be the largest new issue ever, and represent just a small portion of the company’s equity. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would like to see Aramco valued at $2 trillion, about $500 billion more than bankers are currently estimating, according to sources.The company faces tough markets, where oil prices are volatile and near the 2019 low. Brent crude futures were trading below $60 a barrel Monday, and are down 18% over the past year. At the same time, energy stocks have underperformed, with the S&P energy sector up just 1.7% year to date, making it the worst-performing sector and well behind the S&P 500′s 2019 gain of about 16%.“We, in Saudi Aramco, have delivered strong and unmatched financial results, despite lower oil prices and volatile market conditions. This is really a testament to our resilience,” said al-Dabbagh, noting the talks are in the early stages.Saudi Aramco earlier reported first-half net profit of $46.9 billion, down from $53 billion last year due to the impact of lower oil prices. Free cash flow rose 6.7% to $38 billion, and it is that cash flow that some sources believe could help Aramco propel its valuation to $2 trillion.Aramco announced a special dividend of $20 billion, noting it reflects its exceptionally strong 2018 performance.The CFO told investors that the company has sufficient free cash flow to give it enough room to purchase a stake in Reliance Industries, a deal announced by Reliance earlier Monday. The stake in India’s Reliance Industries, an oil and chemicals producer, allows Aramco to diversify ahead of its IPO.“As you and everyone knows, India is a large country with large demand, and I think growing demand,” he said, adding the deal enhances the company’s global downstream strategy.Earlier, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani told his company’s annual meeting that Aramco is the biggest foreign investment in the company ever and among the largest foreign investments ever in India. Under the deal, Aramco would supply its Jamnagar refineries with 700,000 barrels a day of oil on a long-term basis, about half the refining complex’ s capacity.Aramco said that it is focusing more effort on gas development, and that it is an area of growth. It also expects its Marjan and Berri developments to contribute production capacity of 2.5 million cubic meters of gas and 550,000 barrels a day of oil. Marjan is an offshore field off the east coast of Saudi Arabia. and Berri, also in Saudi Arabia, is both onshore and offshore.The company also said its East-West pipeline would soon be expanded to carry 7 million barrels a day of crude, from 5 million currently.— Reuters contributed to this report.",pos
"* U.S. refining subsidiary made $423 million last year - document* Korea, Japan refining subsidiary made $319 million in 2018* News comes as Aramco delays IPOLONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Documents from Saudi Aramco show that the world’s largest oil firm earns only a limited proportion of its profit from foreign refining ventures, an area in which the company plans huge investment.The news comes as Aramco, according to two sources familiar with the matter, has delayed the planned launch of its initial public offering in hopes that pending third-quarter results will bolster investor confidence.A subsidiary that holds Aramco stakes in South Korean refiner S-Oil and Showa Shell of Japan made a net income of $319 million in 2018, accounts seen by Reuters show.Saudi Refining Inc, through which Aramco operates the largest U.S. oil refinery, made $423 million last year, separate accounts showed.The documents, seen by Reuters, do not appear to be in the public domain.The earnings represent a small proportion of Aramco’s $111 billion in net income from 2018. They also illustrate just how profitable Aramco’s core oil-producing business - which pumps about 10% of the world’s oil - actually is.Aramco is making huge investments in overseas downstream operations. With Indian companies and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, it plans to build a giant refinery and petrochemical project that sources say will cost $60 billion.Aramco declined to comment.Selling a stake in Aramco has been a centerpiece of Vision 2030, a plan championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil.Aramco appears to make a small proportion of its profit from refining compared with listed peers. Royal Dutch Shell, for example, earned $7.57 billion from downstream activitues in 2018, almost a quarter of its $23.83 billion annual earnings.In 2018, Aramco received revenue of $138.67 billion from its downstream operations and $216.9 billion from upstream, according to the company’s published acccounts.Some analysts say Aramco’s performance is better than that of its listed peers, based on metrics followed by investors in oil companies.Jason Kenney of Santander said Aramco’s first-half 2019 earnings showed a higher return on capital employed than listed peers and stronger performance on operational yardsticks such as refinery reliability.This highlights “the impressive order of magnitude at which Saudi Aramco is delivering,” he said in a report.(Reporting by Alex Lawler and Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Dale Hudson)",pos
"* Iraq says key members support deeper cuts* Riyadh wants high prices to help Aramco IPO -sources* Russia says expects constructive meeting* JP Morgan expects deeper cuts, Goldman sees roll-over (Updates with Iraq)MOSCOW/VIENNA, Dec 3 (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies led by Russia are gearing up to approve deeper oil production cuts this week to prevent a new glut and a collapse on oil prices with OPEC member Iraq saying the move was supported by key members.Non-OPEC Russia also said it was expecting a constructive meeting as OPEC leader Saudi Arabia presses fellow producers to deepen cuts to increase its budget revenue and raise a good price from the share sale of oil giant Saudi Aramco.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meets on Thursday in Vienna followed by a meeting with Russia and others, a grouping known as OPEC+, on Friday.“A deeper cut is being preferred by a number of key members within OPEC... my understanding is that they (Saudis) do (prefer it),” Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban told reporters in Vienna.OPEC+ has been curtailing output since 2017 to counter oversupply as a result of booming output in the United States, which has become the world’s biggest producer and is not taking part in cuts.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow had yet to finalise its position. “Let’s wait ... But I think the meeting, as usual, will be of a constructive nature,” he told reporters in Moscow.A source familiar with the Russian thinking told Reuters that Moscow would “most likely” reach a consensus with OPEC this week and just needed to iron out a few outstanding issues.Producers must decide to continue, trim, deepen or dump their agreement which currently calls for a collective cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), about 1.2% of global demand.A sticking point for Russia this time is how its output is being measured  it includes gas condensate in its figures, while other producers do not.We will discuss with our colleagues to take account of our statistics the same way as for OPEC countries - excluding condensate,” Novak said.Russia has agreed to reduce output by 228,000 bpd to about 11.18 million bpd under the current deal but it pumped more than that - 11.244 million bpd - in November, Reuters calculations show.Novak said Russia’s average cut was 195,000 bpd in November but by excluding condensate its output cut could be about 225,000-230,000 bpd in December. Moscow has typically taken a tough stance before OPEC+ meetings before approving the policy.FEARS OF NEW GLUTTwo sources told Reuters on Monday that OPEC+ was considering deepening the cuts by at least 400,000 bpd.JP Morgan said it expected producers to agree cuts of 1.5 million bpd to the end of 2020 - an increase of 300,000 bpd - as Saudi Arabia needs oil prices in the region of $60-70 per barrel.Saudi Arabia is also pressing Iraq and Nigeria to improve their compliance with their output quotas as a condition for Saudi cutting more output.Gary Ross, founder of Black Gold Investors, said Saudi need for higher oil revenue was rising with a decline in forex reserves, which are down by more than $25 billion since May, according to the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency.Reports on Monday that OPEC+ was considering deeper cuts helped lift oil prices. On Tuesday, benchmark Brent was steady near $61 a barrel.Without additional cuts the oil market risks a large oversupply and build-up in inventories in the first half of 2020, sources said on Monday citing the latest OPEC analysis, drawn up by OPEC’s Economic Commission Board.Expectations for 2020 U.S. output growth range from as low of 100,000 bpd to as high as 1 million bpd although for many years the market has underestimated U.S. oil production rises.Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Group, said that U.S. output gains aside a major glut was looming next year without extra OPEC cuts because of fresh supply from Brazil, Guyana and Norway.Goldman Sachs analysts said OPEC+ was likely to extend output curbs until June, but said three extra months would provide little support for prices, which they expect to trade around $60 in 2020.NO DEAL?A senior official at the International Energy Agency (IEA), the West’s energy watchdog, said on Tuesday that OPEC was unlikely to agree a change to the output pact this week given uncertainty about the market outlook.“There’s a lot of uncertainties out there, not least the U.S. shale outlook, strength in demand, the overall economic outlook, all the rest of it, that more likely than not they will leave it in place and meet again in March,” said Neil Atkinson, head of the IEA’s oil markets division.

"Saudi oil giant Aramco is undertaking a series of moves that may pave the way for a long-delayed stock market debut.The kingdom plans an initial public offering for Aramco in 2021, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said during a news conference Wednesday. Falih backed the latest target for the IPO with several announcements that would essentially prep the market for the debut, which is expected to be the largest ever.Saudi Arabia on Wednesday released the results of an independent audit that confirms the kingdom controls more than 260 billion barrels in oil reserves. The assessment makes the metrics behind the world’s largest energy company — long the subject of skepticism — a bit less opaque to potential investors in Aramco.“This certification underscores why every barrel we produce is the most profitable in the world, and why we believe Saudi Aramco is the world’s most valuable company and indeed the world’s most important,” Falih said in a statement.Falih later announced Aramco will issue bonds in the second quarter of this year. In order to tap the debt market, Aramco will release additional financial information, offering a wider glimpse into a private company whose inner workings are a closely held secret.“That shows that Aramco’s hesitation about doing an IPO is not about keeping information private,” said Ellen Wald, an independent energy policy analyst at Transversal Consulting. “It’s not because they’re hiding something.”Falih did not say how much the bond sale would seek to raise, but it is widely expected to underwrite at least part of Aramco’s purchase of a majority stake in Saudi petrochemicals company Sabic. The 70 percent stake that Aramco intends to buy is controlled by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and valued at roughly $70 billion.Falih dismissed speculation that Aramco will fund the entire purchase with cash raised in the bond sale. The kingdom is aiming to complete the acquisition and update its balance sheet with the Sabic assets before it presents an IPO to the market.If Aramco follows through in 2021, it would mark the end of a long and winding road.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first floated the idea of listing roughly 5 percent of Aramco on international stock markets in January 2016. The kingdom hoped to fetch a $2 trillion valuation for Aramco and raise about $100 billion to fund Crown Prince Mohammed’s economic transformation plan.Aramco initially targeted the second half of 2018 for the IPO, but the process reportedly got bogged down by indecision over key issues such as where to list shares. Independent assessment also doubted Aramco would be valued at $2 trillion.By early 2018, a plan emerged to first list shares on Saudi Arabia’s domestic stock market. Then, Falih conceded in May that 2019 was the new target for an international listing. In August, Reuters reported that Aramco was scrapping the IPO. Falih dismissed the report and said the company remained committed to its plan.The delay makes sense for several reasons, said Wald, who chronicled Aramco’s history in “Saudi Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom’s Pursuit of Profit and Power.”Today’s IPO market is heavily geared toward companies with huge growth potential, and while Aramco turns tremendous profits, it would be more of a value stock churning out steady dividends, she said.That is the case for international oil companies like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell, but Aramco’s refining and petrochemicals units are small compared with its integrated peers. It makes sense that Aramco would want to shore up this high-value business before being evaluated against other oil majors, according to Wald.Aramco’s plan to tap the debt market also speaks to those ambitions, in her view.“It could indicate that they are looking to make massive expansions beyond what they are self-funding and that’s definitely been indicated by some of the news we’ve heard,” she said.In addition to diversifying into petrochemicals through the Sabic deal, Aramco is reportedly exploring investments in the booming market for liquefied natural gas.Aramco is in talks to buy a stake in a Russian Arctic LNG project, according to Reuters. Aramco is also mulling an investment in one of several planned U.S. LNG terminals, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week.",pos

"(Adds details, background)DUBAI, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Top oil producer Saudi Aramco maintained its position as the world’s most profitable company on Monday even as it reported a 12% drop in first-half net income to $46.9 billion due to lower oil prices.By comparison, Apple Inc, the world’s most profitable listed company, made $31.5 billion in the first six months of its financial year.Aramco said it generated total revenues, including other income related to sales, of $163.88 billion in the first half of this year, down from $167.68 billion a year earlier.Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer, is also taking a 20% stake in the oil to chemicals business of India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani said on Monday, in one of the biggest ever foreign investments in India.State-run Aramco disclosed its closely guarded financials for the first time ever earlier this year, revealing its 2018 earnings in order to obtain a public rating and start issuing international bonds.The figures showed that Aramco was the most profitable company in the world, surpassing U.S. behemoths such as Apple and Exxon Mobil. The Saudi national oil company plans to launch an initial public stock offering or IPO by 2020-2021, having postponed its flotation from 2018.Compared to Aramco’s first half earnings, U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. made around $5.5 billion in the first half of the year, while Royal Dutch Shell reported $8.8 billion.“Despite lower oil prices during the first half of 2019, we continued to deliver solid earnings and strong free cash flow underpinned by our consistent operational performance, cost management an fiscal discipline,” Aramco’s president and chief executive officer Amin Nasser said in a statement.Aramco said the drop in earnings was mainly due to a drop of 4% in the average realized price of crude oil from $69 to $66 per barrel and an increase in purchases, producing and manufacturing costs, and depreciation and amortization costs.The drop was partially offset by a decrease of $2.62 billion in income taxes, the oil company said.Aramco said it had a crude output of 10 million barrels a day in the first six months of the year, little changed from the same period in 2018.Saudi Arabia has been restricting its output under an OPEC-led pact to reduce global oil supply to support prices.Saudi Arabia pumped below 10 million barrels per day for most of 2019.Despite a drop in income, Aramco paid a dividend of $46.4 billion to the government including a special dividend of $20 billion, up from $32 billion a year earlier.This shows Saudi Arabia’s strong dependence on the oil producer to finance the kingdom’s budget needs as well as the lavish lifestyles of its royal family.The Aramco IPO is a centerpiece of Saudi Arabia’s economic transformation drive to attract foreign investment and diversify away from oil.Work on the IPO was halted in 2018 when Aramco shifted its attention to the acquisition of a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries Corp.

"* Saudia Arabia pushing for more cuts to output* OPEC+ may take 400,000 bpd off market* Gains limited as investors sceptical - analyst (Adds comment from Goldman, updates prices)TOKYO, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices gained on Tuesday, as hopes rose for OPEC and its allies to agree deeper output cuts when they meet this week, although gains were limited, amid some analysts’ scepticism over the achievement of further reductions.Brent futures rose 17 cents, or 0.3%, to $61.09 a barrel by 0516 GMT, after having gained 0.7% on Monday.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 25 cents, or 0.5%, at $56.21 a barrel. The contract rose 1.4% on Monday.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, are discussing a plan to increase an existing supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) by a further 400,000 bpd and extend the pact until June, two sources familiar with the matter said.Saudi Arabia is pushing the plan to deliver a positive surprise to the market before the initial public offering (IPO) of state-owned Saudi Aramco, the sources said.“We believe the global oil supply-demand balance requires an extension of the current OPEC+ cuts,” Goldman Sachs said in a research note.The factors behind this view included a large increase in production from legacy non-OPEC projects and a still uncertain outlook for demand growth, it added.The investment bank said it expected Brent to trade around $60 a barrel in 2020, “absent new growth or geopolitical shocks”.OPEC ministers will meet in Vienna on Thursday and the wider OPEC+ group will gather on Friday.″(The) oil price is little moved today, suggesting that traders are sceptical about the additional 400,000 bpd cut on top of the extension of (the) current production cut agreement,” said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore.Concerns about the inability of the United States and China, the world’s two biggest oil users, to reach a preliminary deal to resolve their 17-month trade dispute also weighed on oil prices, along with discouraging U.S. economic data.A senior adviser to President Donald Trump said a U.S.-China trade deal was still possible before the end of the year, adding that the first phase of the agreement was being put to paper, although the talks have dragged on for weeks.While OPEC may cut output, U.S. producers have been only too happy to meet any market shortfalls, with production setting successive records. Growth into 2020, though, may range between 100,000 bpd and 1 million bpd.U.S. crude inventories are expected to have declined last week, which may support prices, with analysts in a preliminary Reuters poll suggesting a contraction of 1.8 million barrels.In a sign of buying interest for oil, fund managers increased net long positions in U.S. crude futures and options in the week to Nov. 26, the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission said.(Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Clarence Fernandez)",pos
"The CEO of Saudi state-owned oil giant Aramco on Sunday said he cannot say whether his company will list shares on the public stock market by 2020.Last fall, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC the IPO — expected to be the world’s largest ever — was on track for 2018. However, Nasser and Saudi officials have since sought to temper the market’s expectations.On Sunday, Nasser told CNBC that Aramco’s plans to buy a strategic position in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries, or SABIC, will delay the IPO indefinitely.Asked whether it would be accurate to report that Aramco still plans to list shares by 2020, Nasser said he did not want to commit.“I don’t want to talk about dates at this stage,” Nasser told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan. “From our side, I just want to say — reiterate — that the government has announced that they are committed to the IPO.”Saudi Arabia had hoped to raise about $100 billion and attract a $2 trillion valuation for Aramco by listing shares of the company on the stock market. The plan was the cornerstone of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s effort to substantially expand Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund and underwrite an ambitious plan dubbed Vision 2030 to diversify the nation’s economy.Saudi officials long maintained the IPO would happen by the end of this year, even as reports surfaced that the kingdom, Aramco’s sole shareholder, was at an impasse over critical decisions, such as where to list shares.In March, sources said Aramco would delay an international listing and first list shares on the domestic stock market. Two months later, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih conceded that a 2019 listing was more likely.Reuters reported last month that Saudi Arabia had scrapped plans for the IPO altogether and dismissed advisers. The news agency said King Salman bin Abdulaziz had soured on the plan. Falih denied the reports in an official statement, saying Saudi Arabia will launch the IPO when the time is right.Nasser told CNBC the Reuters report is “incorrect.” He noted that Aramco has undertaken a substantial amount of work to prepare for the IPO, including converting the enterprise into a joint stock company, appointing new board members and having its reserves audited by a third party.“All the elements that are required for listing Saudi Aramco were done. So it shows you the commitment of the government for listing Saudi Aramco,” he said.Aramco in July confirmed that it is in early stage discussions with the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund to purchase the sovereign wealth fund’s 70 percent stake in SABIC. The acquisition would advance Aramco’s goal of producing more high value petrochemicals and deliver a windfall to the Public Investment Fund, offsetting the need for the Aramco IPO.Nasser warned in July that negotiations over SABIC could delay the Aramco IPO. On Sunday, he told CNBC that Aramco is still in the early stages of due diligence.If the deal moves forward, Aramco will need to negotiate the sale with the Public Investment Fund and go through various regulatory processes. If and when the deal is finalized, Aramco will have to overhaul its balance sheet to integrate SABIC, he said.“It’s a major deal. We are doing the due diligence currently. And you cannot list while you are going through an acquisition of this size,” Nasser said.",pos
"Sept 16 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia officials are discussing delaying Aramco's initial public offering as attacks on the company's oil facilities have drastically reduced their output, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.The company is expected to move forward with presentations to analysts and meetings with bankers as planned. However, Saudi energy officials and Aramco executives are debating a rescheduling of the IPO until after the company fully restores its production to normal levels.Discussions of a change in the offering's timing have been confined to Saudi officials and Aramco executives, the report said.Yemen's Houthi Group on Saturday claimed responsibility for the drone attacks on two Aramco's plants.Aramco had planned to list 1% shares of the state oil plant on the Riyadh stock exchange before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020, Reuters reported last week.Based on the indicated $2 trillion valuation that Saudi Aramco had hoped to achieve, a 1% float would be worth $20 billion.

"strong demand -sources@ (Adds Alibaba spokeswoman comment in 5th par and Aramco IPO comparison)HONG KONG, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Alibaba will stop taking orders from prospective institutional investors for its $13.4 billion secondary listing in Hong Kong earlier than expected after attracting strong demand, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.Order books will now close on Tuesday at 12 p.m. in New York (1700 GMT), half a day earlier than initially planned by the Chinese e-commerce giant and its investment banking advisers.The decision was made by the company on Monday, the sources said. The final price that institutional investors will pay will still be set by Wednesday evening Hong Kong time, based on Tuesday’s closing price in New York, they added.The sources, who could not be named because the information has not yet been made public, also told Reuters that the order books are covered multiple times.An Alibaba spokeswoman declined to comment on the company’s decision to close the books early.The listing is part of a year-end equity market rush which also includes the IPO of Saudi oil giant Aramco.The price range set by Aramco on Sunday values the company at up to $1.7 trillion, below the $2 trillion sought by Saudi Arabia’s crown prince.But the valuation still keeps it in the running to become the world’s largest IPO, potentially topping Alibaba’s record $25 billion New York stock market debut in 2014 if there is enough demand to use an over-allotment option.Alibaba’s stock is due to start trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on November 26, according to a prospectus lodged with New York regulators, with a listing ceremony scheduled for that day.The stockmarket debut in Hong Kong comes as the Chinese-controlled city battles worsening violence on the streets in anti-government protests which have been ongoing for nearly six months.More than 4000 people have been arrested during that time and China warned on Monday that the world should not under-estimate its will to protect Hong Kong from ‘criminals conducting violence against civilians’.

"RIYADH/LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to list 1% of state oil giant Saudi Aramco on the Riyadh stock exchange before the end of 2019 and another 1% in 2020, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman eventually wants around 5% of the company to be public as the centrepiece of his plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil, attract foreign investments and create jobs.But rather than go straight for an initial public offering on an international stock market, the company is planning a gradual listing at home first, according to people familiar with the matter.“The thinking now is to list 1% this year, and another next year. This will be easier for the stock market to absorb,” said one source familiar with the first stage of the planned listing.“The smaller the target liquidity, the easier and the sooner the local IPO will be,” said the source, adding that the listing would be open to qualified foreign investors.Aramco is preparing to sell up to a 5% stake by 2020-2021, in what could be the world’s biggest IPO. It is still meeting banks pitching for roles on the deal, and is expected to appoint the advisers in the coming days, sources have told Reuters.“So far there has been a discussion about the symbolic 1% to 2% listing on the Tadawul (Riyadh bourse), with 1% being the consensus,” said the second source, a senior banker.Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Based on the indicated $2 trillion valuation that Saudi Aramco had hoped to achieve, a 1% float would be worth $20 billion - huge for the local market.Analysts and bankers, however, say $1.5 trillion is a more achievable valuation for the world’s biggest oil company.The exact timing of the listing on Tadawul, the Middle East’s largest bourse, has not yet been decided, the sources said. A third source said it might be announced at a major annual investment conference in Riyadh scheduled for the end of October.(Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal in Dubai; Editing by Rachel Armstrong and Deepa Babington)",pos
"Saudi Arabia has scrapped its plans to list shares of state-owned energy giant Aramco on stock exchanges, according to  Reuters, but the kingdom is disputing that report.The nation’s powerful crown prince still wants to take Aramco public at some point in the future, sources familiar with the process told CNBC. The IPO is now less urgent because oil prices have rebounded above $70 a barrel, relieving pressure on Saudi finances, sources said.Multiple sources told CNBC it would be inaccurate to say Aramco has canceled the IPO. Work associated with the offering has indeed slowed down as Aramco focuses on another large deal, but advisers have not been dismissed indefinitely, one of the sources said.An initial public offering from Aramco is expected to be the largest ever and is at the center of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious plan to overhaul the Saudi economy. The Saudis hope to attract a $2 trillion valuation for Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, though some outside analysts have pegged its value at half that amount.Doubt has been swirling around the IPO for months as the kingdom deferred making decisions on key parts of the stock market debut, including where to list shares overseas. Skepticism only grew deeper earlier this year when sources familiar with the process said Aramco would first list on its domestic exchange, the Tadawul, and put off an international listing.Now, the kingdom will no longer seek to publicly list shares at home or abroad and Saudi Aramco has dismissed advisers working on the deal, several sources told Reuters. One source said the decision to cancel the IPO had been made “some time ago.”Aramco is now focusing on acquiring a stake in Saudi Basic Industries, or SABIC, a domestic petrochemical company, source told CNBC. That in part explains why advisers on the Aramco deal have been sidelined, the sources said.Aramco initially declined to comment, but on Wednesday evening, the company’s chairman and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih issued a statement calling the Reuters report was not true.“The Government remains committed to the IPO of Saudi Aramco at a time of its own choosing when conditions are optimum,” Falih said. “This timing will depend on multiple factors, including favorable market conditions, and a downstream acquisition which the Company will pursue in the next few months, as directed by its Board of Directors.If Saudi Aramco confirms the report, it would mark the end of more than 2½ years of intense market speculation, competition among exchanges and jockeying among banks for a role in the lucrative offering.Crown Prince Mohammed first made the plans public in January 2016, when he was still the kingdom’s deputy crown prince.The plan emerged during the depths of a crushing oil price downturn that sent crude futures from more than $100 a barrel to less than $30. The rout pushed Saudi Arabia’s budget into a deficit and ultimately forced the kingdom to coordinate production cuts among about two dozen oil-producing nations.Saudi Arabia hoped to raise about $100 billion by offering the public the opportunity to own a small portion of Aramco. The kingdom planned to use the funds to expand its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, and underwrite the crown prince’s Vision 2030, a blueprint to diversify the nation’s economy.Stock exchanges in New York, London and Hong Kong emerged leading contenders to list Aramco shares. The crown prince reportedly favored listing on the New York Stock Exchange, but market watchers questioned whether Aramco, known for its secrecy, could meet the NYSE’s stringent transparency standards.Amin Nasser, CEO of Aramco, told CNBC earlier this year that his company was prepared for a public offering in the second half of 2018, but was waiting for the government to choose an exchange. Indecision over the listing venue snarled the process, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year.Aramco in July confirmed media reports that it had entered talks with the Public Investment Fund, to acquire a “strategic stake” in SABIC, the Saudi petrochemical company. The fund has a 70 percent stake in SABIC.Aramco said the move would be consistent with Aramco’s strategy of diversifying into high value businesses, including refining crude oil into fuels and processing byproducts into petrochemicals like plastics. Aramco currently focuses on producing crude oil from that nation’s vast reserves.The deal would also allow the Public Investment Fund to generate cash from its investment in SABIC.— CNBC’s David Faber contributed reporting to this story.",pos
"Saudi Arabia’s king in waiting says the stock market debut for the kingdom’s oil giant Aramco will go forward by early 2021.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman gave the update for the initial public offering in an interview with Bloomberg one month after Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia had scrapped plans to list shares in the company. Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih disputed that report, saying the kingdom would take Aramco public when the time is right.That time now appears to be roughly two years from now, according to the crown prince, who is often referred to as MBS. The royal also reiterated his view that Aramco is worth $2 trillion, though analysts have said a $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion valuation is more likely.“I believe late 2020, early 2021,” MBS told Bloomberg. “The investor will decide the price on the day. I believe it will be above $2 trillion. Because it will be huge.”The kingdom was originally targeting 2018 for the IPO, but Falih said earlier this year 2019 looked more likely.Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC last month that the IPO would be delayed indefinitely by the company’s bid to purchase a majority stake in petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, or SABIC.Despite the delay, Nasser said the government remained committed to taking a portion of Aramco public.Aramco did not immediately have a response to the comments by MBS on the IPO.MBS first announced plans to list shares of Aramco in 2016. The IPO is at the center of Vision 2030, the crown prince’s ambitious effort to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy and reduce its reliance on the oil sector.The plan was for revenues from the IPO — projected at about $100 billion — to flow into the nation’s Public Investment Fund. MBS told Bloomberg that is still the plan, and that the PIF would also get a $70 million windfall by selling Aramco its 70 percent stake in SABIC.MBS said he expects the SABIC deal to close in 2019, after which Aramco will wait one financial year to launch the IPO.— This is a breaking news story.

"(Adds source quotes, context throughout)DUBAI/RIYADH, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco <IPO-ARMO.SE> has delayed the planned launch of its initial public offering in hopes that pending third-quarter results will bolster investor confidence in the world’s largest oil firm, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.Aramco had been expected to announce plans next week to float a 1% to 2% stake on the kingdom’s Tadawul market, in what could have been one of the largest ever public offerings, worth upwards of $20 billion.However, after a Sept. 14 attack on its Abqaiq and Khurais plants temporarily knocked out half its crude output, the world’s top exporter wants to reassure investors by first presenting results covering the period, the two sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the information is not public.“They want to do all that they can to hit the valuation target. Solid results after the attack will put them in a stronger position,” said one of the sources.The second source confirmed the offering had been postponed, and there was currently no new date set for the listing. Neither source knew when third quarter results were likely to come out.The news comes after Reuters, citing sources familiar with the IPO, reported on Sept. 24 that the offering was unlikely to happen this year in light of the attacks.The Financial Times, which initially reported the IPO delay on Thursday, cited a source as saying the listing was delayed by “weeks”.Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment outside regular working hours.The prospect of Aramco selling a piece of itself has had Wall Street on tenterhooks since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first flagged it three years ago.However, his desired $2 trillion valuation has always been questioned by some financiers and industry experts who note that countries have been accelerating efforts to shift away from fossil fuels to curb global warming, putting oil prices under pressure and undermining producers’ equity value.Then came the September attack, which initially knocked out 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of production, or more than 5% of global oil supply.Aramco executives have insisted since the attack that it would have no impact on its plans to list the company. The full restoration of oil output as declared by Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Oct. 3 - at a faster clip than expected - was seen boosting the company’s image.“The official line was that the Q3 results were very good, so they want to update the analysts and market the IPO after the Q3 numbers,” the second source said.Aramco halted plans for a blockbuster international listing of around 5% last year amid debate over where to list overseas, but talks resumed this summer.They were given impetus by the appointment of Yasir al-Rumayyan, a close ally of Prince Mohammed and former investment banker, as chairman of Aramco. A host of banks were given roles to arrange the listing.Saudi investors see the IPO as a chance to own part of the kingdom’s crown jewel and an opportunity to show patriotism after the attack.

"Investors hoping to a buy a piece of the world’s largest oil company may be forced to wait until 2019 at the earliest, amid reports Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO) is likely to be delayed.Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil behemoth had planned to begin trading on the country’s domestic stock market — the Tadawul — and one or more foreign exchanges in the second half of 2018. However, Aramco’s listing is now no longer expected to take place this year, according to a Financial Times report citing British officials briefed on the matter.“I’m guessing investors are going to be a bit disappointed but they have no choice other than to stay patient and jump on the bandwagon when it finally happens,” Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates, told CNBC in a phone interview Monday.The Financial Times report suggested Aramco’s IPO — widely seen as the cornerstone project of the kingdom’s efforts to reform its economy — is struggling to arrive at the $2 trillion valuation sought by Saudi’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.In an interview with Bloomberg last week, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that while Aramco’s offering could conceivably take place in 2019, the timeline would not be especially relevant.“Between December 31 and January 1, there is no value lost for the kingdom,” al-Falih said, before adding: “So I don’t understand this artificial deadline you refer to as being significant.”London, New York and Hong Kong are among the foreign bourses competing for the share sale. Saudi’s Bin Salman is believed to favor listing in New York, while officials, including Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, reportedly favor London.A domestic listing and a private sale to a strategic investor — possibly from Beijing — is another possibility.“Maybe they are starting to realize their original $2 trillion valuation may be on the high side and so have decided to postpone,” Varga said.Indecision at the highest levels of Saudi Arabia’s government is thought to have stoked frustration among company executives. This discontent comes at a time when deadlines for the listing have frequently been pushed back and eleventh-hour privatization options have also emerged.Meanwhile, the prospect of a delayed IPO would also represent a significant setback for a central plank of Riyadh’s plans to modernize its economy.Saudi Aramco, currently a private company owned by the kingdom’s government, is aiming for an IPO that could raise about $100 billion and attract a valuation in the range of $1 trillion to $2 trillion.Last month, BP CEO Bob Dudley told CNBC that he expected “little market dislocations” would be to blame for any looming disruptions to Saudi Aramco’s plans to list. “The big questions are if they do, when? And where would they list? I think that debate seems to me to be alive and well,” he added.",pos
"(Adds details, graphics)* OPEC, allies to discuss supply-curb policy on Dec. 5-6* Output from de facto OPEC leader Saudi rebounds sharply* Slow refining cuts crude demand for first time in decadeLONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies face stiffening competition in 2020, the International Energy Agency said on Friday, adding urgency to the oil producer group’s policy meeting next month.“The OPEC+ countries face a major challenge in 2020 as demand for their crude is expected to fall sharply,” the Paris-based agency said in a monthly report.The IEA estimated non-OPEC supply growth would surge to 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) next year compared to 1.8 million bpd in 2019, citing production from the United States, Brazil, Norway and Guyana.“The hefty supply cushion that is likely to build up during the first half of next year will offer cold comfort to OPEC+ ministers gathering in Vienna at the start of next month,” it added.While U.S. supply rose by 145,000 bpd in October, the IEA said, a slowdown in activity that started earlier this year looks set to continue as companies prioritise capital discipline.Demand for crude oil from OPEC in 2020 will be 28.9 million bpd, the IEA forecast, 1 million bpd below the exporter club’s current production.The recovery by OPEC’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia from attacks on the country’s oil infrastructure contributed 1.4 million bpd to the global oil supply increase in October of 1.5 million bpd.“With plans underway for the Aramco IPO and the persistent need for revenues to fund the government budget, Riyadh has every incentive to keep oil prices supported,” the IEA said.Saudi state oil company Aramco, the worlds most profitable firm, starts a share sale on Nov. 17 in an initial public offering (IPO) that may raise between $20 billion and $40 billion.It was the IEA’s last monthly report before the Dec. 5-6 talks among OPEC states and partners led by Russia on whether to maintain supply curbs aimed at buoying prices and balancing the market.The agency kept its assessments for growth in global oil demand in 2019 and 2020 at 1 million bpd and 1.2 million bpd respectively, but said its outlook might slightly underestimate the impact of tariffs from the U.S.-China trade war.The IEA said that if some or all tariffs were lifted in coming months, “world economic growth and oil demand growth would both rise significantly”, though the rebound may not be immediate.Sluggish refinery activity in the first three quarters has caused crude oil demand to fall in 2019 for the first time since 2009, the IEA said, but refining is set to rebound sharply in the fourth quarter and in 2020.(Reporting by Noah Browning; Editing by Dale Hudson)",neg
"The world’s largest initial public offering (IPO) will radically transform the way in which Saudi Arabia’s economy operates, according to the chief executive of the Saudi Stock Exchange.So far, Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul is the only confirmed listing exchange for state-owned energy giant, Saudi Aramco. The kingdom has estimated the much-anticipated listing of the world’s top oil company could be worth up to $2 trillion. “The Saudi Stock Exchange is as excited as everybody else with the listing of Aramco,” Khalid Abdullah Al Hussan, CEO of the Saudi Stock Exchange, told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble in Riyadh on Wednesday.“It is almost doubling the size of the Saudi market and that is definitely changing our position as far as size ...

The “unique” listing is expected to dramatically change the face of the Tadawul exchange, with Saudi Aramco poised to dominate roughly one-third of the index. That could increase the likelihood of Saudi stocks moving in tandem with oil prices — despite the kingdom’s long-term goal to try to diversify its economy away from oil.While some of the world’s leading stock exchanges and governments have attempted to lobby Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in an effort to be able to list Saudi Aramco alongside the Tadawul, Riyadh’s exchange has been scrambling to try to ready itself for the forthcoming IPO.In March, the Tadawul’s progress received a timely boost to its preparations as the country’s stock market received approval to join the benchmark FTSE Emerging Markets index. That was widely seen as a positive step, as the approval is expected to push billions of fresh international capital onto Riyadh’s relatively small exchange.More recently, the kingdom is also waiting to see whether it will be awarded emerging market status in the influential MSCI benchmark equity index. Significantly more money tracks emerging markets which should allow the Tadawul to attract Western funds, in addition to other flagship investors from China, Japan and South Korea.The Tadawul also announced the launch of its own independent clearing house on Wednesday. The move was thought to mark another step in the country’s “Vision 2030” reform initiative.  The Central Counterparty Clearing House (CCP) is designed to try to further strengthen the Saudi market’s infrastructure and help increase the exchange’s operational efficiency. A clearing house acts as a third party between buyers and sellers on all futures and options contracts in a bid to try to improve the stability of the financial system.Still, there are many that doubt the Tadawul’s ability to manage the world’s largest-ever IPO. When asked what investors could expect from the Saudi stock market as it prepares for the listing of Aramco, the Tadawul’s Al Hussan replied: “People expect an accessible market... Fair, secure and well-functioning.“Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange hosts around 191 companies, with a total value of approximately $500 billion.",pos
"Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are poised to take a major role in the sale of a portion of Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant, which is expected to be the biggest initial public offering ever, according to multiple reports.Saudi Aramco aims to offer investors a 5 percent stake in the company this year. The IPO is central to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s effort to create the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund and diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy.Saudi officials have said Aramco could attract a $2 trillion valuation, though others forecast the offering will value the company at $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion. The kingdom aims to raise about $100 billion to underwrite Crown Prince Mohammed’s “Vision 2030” economic transformation plan.It also stands to enrich banks that secure a role in a complicated offering for a sprawling enterprise deeply intertwined with Saudi Arabia’s state finances.The slow pace of progress toward an Aramco IPO has fueled speculation that the sale could be delayed beyond 2018. But on Monday, Bloomberg News reported that Aramco is likely to name Goldman and Citi as lead managers for the offering.Also on Monday, Reuters reported that the Saudis have invited Goldman and Citi, along with Deutsche Bank, to the kingdom to pitch for a role in the share sale in the coming weeks.Three other banks that have advised Aramco on the pending share sale — J.P. Morgan Chase, HSBC and Morgan Stanley — are also expected to be global coordinators, according to news reports going back to last year.Aramco and the banks declined to comment on the Bloomberg and Reuters reports.In another recent sign that momentum toward an Aramco IPO is picking up steam, the Saudi government on Friday announced it had changed Aramco’s status to a joint-stock company, a move that lets the company issue shares.Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC in October that the Aramco offering remained on track for 2018, despite reports that the kingdom was considering shelving the IPO in favor of a private share sale to the Chinese government and others.Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil exporter. It has spearheaded an effort among its fellow OPEC members, Russia and several other oil-producing nations to kill a global glut of crude that has weighed on prices.An agreement among the nations to cap production has helped boost oil prices above $60 a barrel, a condition industry watchers widely see as necessary for a successful Aramco IPO. The production limits began in January 2017, and the deal is scheduled to remain in place through the end of this year.",neg
"Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco could first issue stock on its home market and privately place shares in the hands of big Asian investors before facing the complexity of listing on an international exchange.That is one idea under consideration for what could be the world's largest public offering. Starting the process in Saudi Arabia could simplify Aramco's recapitalization, which is a centerpiece of the kingdom's goal of diversity away from oil under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan.The Saudi government hopes to raise $100 billion from a sale of 5 percent of Aramco, but the valuation is still uncertain. Also uncertain is the timing of an offering, which appears to be drifting into 2019 from an earlier goal of 2018. Aramco officials continue to say the IPO process is on ""track."" ""A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track,"" said a Saudi Aramco official.Aramco has said it is ready to go forward with the IPO but awaits the go-ahead from the government. Officials have also said the local exchange Tadawul would be the anchor market. One factor favoring the idea of first listing locally is the anticipated award in June of emerging market status for Saudi Arabia by index firm MSCI. That designation could bring a wave of foreign capital into the local market next year as global fund managers add Saudi Arabia to their holdings. ""It makes sense for them to list on the Saudi stock exchange, even if this is the first listing that we have,"" said John Sfakianikis, director of economic research at the Gulf Research Center.   A local stock sale would get around stricter disclosures required by bigger foreign exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange or London Stock Exchange. But both of them, as well as Hong Kong, would provide far more liquidity than Tadawul.Reuters reported that there's a 50 percent chance Saudi Aramco could list locally and skip an international IPO altogether. But a source close to the IPO said the company's goal is to issue stock both at home and abroad.""They are absolutely intent on doing this internationally,"" the source said. The international listing is believed to be important to the crown prince, who is heir apparent of his 82-year-old father King Salman.The 32-year-old crown prince is expected to visit the U.S. next week, and President Donald Trump has made it clear he would like to see the international listing in New York. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih has said it would be a risk to list in New York because of liabilities and litigation, including the climate change lawsuits against other oil companies by New York City.According to the Financial Times, the London Stock Exchange is still in the running but not until 2019 at this point.Peter Donisanu, Wells Fargo global market strategist, said the size of the whole Aramco listing on the local exchange could be problematic. But Aramco could also just float part of the stock there.  ""You float out that much into a $450 billion market, it's going to make up a quarter of the market cap, so movements of that company would affect that market as a whole. That's one consideration for MSCI when they're thinking of moving Saudi Arabia away from a non-affiliated market in the emerging market basket,"" said Donisanu. ""MSCI doesn't make these considerations in isolation. It makes them in consultation with big money managers."" ",pos
"The world’s largest initial public offering is on hiatus. The spending it was to enable may not be.Saudi Arabia planned to take its giant oil company, Saudi Aramco, to the public markets. It was to be the linchpin of a grand economic vision, generating billions of dollars to pay for future-proofing the kingdom’s economy, including huge investments in technology.It is now postponed, leaving a large funding shortfall. But Saudi Arabia is pursuing alternative transactions that could ensure its dreams aren’t dashed:• Saudi Aramco is in discussions to buy a large stake in Sabic, a publicly traded chemical company. Sabic’s controlling shareholder is Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. While the size of that potential acquisition is unclear, media reports say it could be as big as $70 billion.• The Public Investment Fund is in talks to raise $11 billion in bank loans from international lenders, according to The Financial Times. It would be the first time the sovereign wealth fund borrowed money.• Saudi Aramco could still sell a stake in itself. Big companies in China and Russia reportedly expressed interest in an investment in the past. It isn’t clear how much a sale would raise, but it would almost certainly run to billions of dollars.Read more from The New York Times:Saudi Arabia is said to postpone its potentially record-breaking IPOElon Musk wants to take Tesla private.

The Saudi government would then have the financial firepower to pursue its grand economic goals, collectively known as Vision 2030.That means money to invest in Silicon Valley start-ups. Or to create a giant new city that runs on clean energy and robots.Or to even help Elon Musk take Tesla private.

"Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman said Monday that there is a case for companies on course to deliver a significant amount of liquidity to consider a dual-listing.State oil giant Saudi Aramco is expected to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in the second half of 2018. The planned floatation has left a flurry of global stock exchanges competing to host the world’s largest oil producer — with the listing poised to become the largest in history.Speaking to CNBC at the World Government Summit in Dubai, Friedman said a company looking at the prospect of dual-listing across different time zones would usually be able to benefit from “liquidity pools” as people wake up in different parts of the world.And when asked whether investors could expect to see Saudi Aramco list on the Nasdaq later this year, she replied: “Companies want to be part of the future, they don’t necessarily want to be part of the past… We are extremely proud of all the companies that choose to come to Nasdaq but we don’t comment on any specific issuer.”Saudi officials claim preparatory work regarding the IPO has been completed but some key issues — such as where to list — rest with the government.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is believed to favor listing Saudi Aramco in New York, while officials, including Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, have reportedly said London could be a better fit. Hong Kong is also in contention.Another option is a Saudi listing alongside an international exchange. A domestic listing and a private sale to a strategic investor — possibly from Beijing — is a third possibility.Indecision at the highest levels of Saudi Arabia’s government is reportedly playing a major role in holding up the planned flotation of the world’s largest oil producer.Saudi Aramco, currently a private company owned by the government in Riyadh, is aiming for an IPO that could raise about $100 billion and attract a valuation in the range of $1 trillion to $2 trillion later this year.

"Saudi billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal on Monday floated the idea that the kingdom could publicly list an increasing portion of its state oil giant Saudi Aramco in the coming years.""No one talks about this idea that if you go 5 percent, there's nothing that prohibits you from going another 5 percent next year, and 5 percent the third year and fourth year, and so forth, depending on the situation,""  he told CNBC on Monday from his apartment in Riyadh.""Now, I know this is our treasure, and we have to keep it, but that treasure also needs to support the country,"" the chairman of Kingdom Holding Company added in an exclusive interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""Saudi Arabia is aiming to launch an initial public offering for Saudi Aramco next year and is expected to offer about 5 percent of the company to investors. The IPO is expected to be the largest ever.On Sunday, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC the listing is on track for the second half of 2018.During that interview, Nasser denied reports that Saudi Aramco is considering shelving the IPO in favor of selling private shares to big institutional investors or sovereign wealth funds, the investment vehicles that manage nations' money. He also swatted down a report that China is a leading contender for such an investment.Even if Saudi Arabia did seek a large investor in Saudi Aramco prior to the listing, it would not necessarily delay the IPO, Alwaleed said on Monday. In fact, it might expedite the process by confirming the price that Saudi Aramco is seeking, he said.""I'm not a member of the government, but I read these reports, and I will not be surprised if China will be looking at this opportunity because China depends on oil and will depend on oil for a long time to come. And Saudi Arabia is an anchor exporter of oil to China,"" he said.The kingdom aims to raise about $100 billion by taking a portion of its state oil giant Saudi Aramco public. The funds will underwrite an effort led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the nation's economy through a plan called Vision 2030.The precipitous drop of oil prices from more than $100 a barrel in 2014 to roughly $55 today has hastened Saudi Arabia's transition from a petrostate to a Gulf nation built on a broader range of industries.Alwaleed said he fully backs the transformation plan, which he believes fulfills the requirements to safeguard Saudi Arabia's economy that he laid out prior to King Salman bin Abdulaziz's rise to the throne in 2015.""Saudi Arabia is in the midst of a major overhaul and change on all fronts — economical, financial, social, entertainment and even political,"" he said.""We always heard about the so-called Arab Spring in certain Arab countries,"" he said, referring to the wave of political protests throughout the Middle East and North Africa that peaked in 2011.

The comment echoes public statements made in the past week by both Khalid Al-Falih, Saudi energy minister, and Saudi Aramco President Amin Nasser.But  echoed speculation that has been circulating as Saudi Aramco officials debate how and when to issue shares. The report is also the latest in a series to cast doubt on the massive IPO which would be five percent of what would be the world's largest listed oil company.One source close to the IPO told CNBC that one thing under review is whether to list on the Saudi market first and then list on an international exchange at a later date. The source said the debate is understood to be between a London or New York listing, given the need for substantial capital market to raise such large sums.The newspaper report quoted five unidentified sources saying that talks about a sale to a foreign government, including China, and other investors have picked up in recent weeks, amid concerns about the feasibility of a foreign listing.An energy market source said talks with Asian sovereign wealth funds and western institutions have been ongoing since the idea of the IPO was first floated.""The definition of an IPO could also mean private placement with Asian sovereign wealth funds,"" the source said. ""They've been in discussions with them about the IPO from the beginning.""The source added that the difficulties of a listing , including the transparency requirements are certainly a consideration for Aramco, which is government owned and intertwined with the bureaucracy of the kingdom.""Saudi Aramco thinks by years, if not decades and financial markets think quarter by quarter,"" said the source.Helima Croft, head of global commodities research at RBC, notes that all previous stories about issues or delays with the 2018 IPO have been quickly denied.""I think it is always worth remembering that a key goal of the Aramco sale was to yield ‎$100 billion for the Public Investment Fund.

"Alibaba plans to launch a Hong Kong share offering to raise $10 billion to $15 billion in the final week of November, in a deal that could boost the Asian financial hub as it struggles with anti-government protests.The U.S.-listed Chinese e-commerce giant is due to seek approval from Hong Kong’s listing committee on Thursday, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The listing process and bookbuild would then proceed during the week of Nov. 25, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.An Alibaba spokesman declined to comment to Reuters on the timing of the listing.The transaction, Dealogic data showed, would be the world’s biggest-ever cross-border secondary listing. Alibaba currently holds the record for the world’s biggest initial public offering for its $25 billion 2014 float in New York.The e-commerce giant’s Hong Kong listing would also set up a year-end rush for global equity markets, with the Saudi government planning to sell 2% of oil giant Aramco in a deal that could raise up to $30 billion and topple Alibaba’s own IPO record.Alibaba had initially been working on an August listing in Hong Kong but put the deal on hold as anti-government protests in the city created financial and political uncertainty.The new timing means the company will have an opportunity to show prospective investors its most recent sales figures after Monday’s Singles Day, mainland China’s largest annual online shopping day.Alibaba’s sales last year reached $30 billion on the day, which was more than three times as large as Cyber Monday, the equivalent shopping day in the U.S.Alibaba last week reported second-quarter revenue increased by 40%, to 119.02 billion yuan ($16.91 billion) in the second quarter from 85.15 billion yuan in the previous year earlier.The result beat analysts’ expectations of revenue of 116.8 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.The company will next week appoint more banks to help sell its shares in Hong Kong, sources said.The deal is currently being led by China International Capital Corp. (CICC) and Credit Suisse. Major investment banks led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are currently jockeying for the most senior positions behind those two.Alibaba has also worked closely with Deutsche Bank in the past, according to Refinitiv statistics, but the bank slashed headcount in its equity capital market business worldwide this summer.If both the Alibaba and Aramco deals succeed, they could provide a shot in the arm for moribund capital markets, where investors have proved increasingly skeptical of the valuations sought by much-hyped tech start-ups such as ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies, which has fallen 34 % since its float in May.More recently, office-space sharing startup WeWork was forced to drop IPO plans and seek a cash injection from Japan’s SoftBank, a major shareholder, as its valuation collapsed to $8 billion from $47 billion as recently as January this year.Companies so far this year have sold shares worth $429 billion via IPOs and follow-on sales — running far short of the $604 billion they sold in the whole of 2018, according to data from Refinitiv.",pos
"Saudi Aramco is working to secure billions of dollars in cheap loans from banks seeking to strengthen their ties with the oil giant before its stock listing, banking and export credit agency (ECA) sources said.Citigroup (Citi), Standard Chartered and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation were advising on the transactions, which two sources said could raise at least $5 billion to $6 billion, all with ECA-backing.The bid to raise funds is the latest indication of Saudi Arabia’s push to ensure what could be the world’s biggest initial public offering (IPO) goes ahead in 2018, despite market speculation that sale plans might be delayed or even shelved.The loans will offer slim returns - probably less than 1 percent a year - but the sources said the banks hoped to position themselves for more work as the kingdom proceeds with selling up to 5 percent of Aramco in an IPO that could value the firm at $2 trillion.For its part, Aramco wants to leverage its balance sheet before the IPO, after which it could face higher costs because, once listed, it would cease to be a solely state-owned entity benefitting from cheap funds available to sovereign borrowers.ECAs offer loan guarantees and sometimes financing to help remove political and other risks facing exporters, encouraging trade and lowering the costs of international business.“There’s momentum for Aramco to tap this form of financing. If they did it after the IPO, they’d have to pay more,” one banker said.Citi was advising Aramco for loans backed by British and U.S. ECAs, Standard Chartered was advising on ECA funding from continental Europe and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation was advising on transactions backed by Asian ECAs, the sources said.The bank mandates expire in 2018, one of the sources said. Citi and Standard Chartered declined to comment. Aramco and Sumitomo Mitsui did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The sources said it was difficult to establish Aramco’s precise needs due to its extensive spending plans and because the loans would finance both new and existing contracts.Aramco has already obtained a $2 billion loan guaranteed by the UK Export Finance agency (UKEF). Citi had a lead role on that transaction.It was now looking at deals which could involve the South Korean and Japanese ECAs, and at least one more deal that could involve a European ECA, the sources said.Each of these new loans was likely to be in the range of $2 billion dollars, the sources added.The ECA-backed loans would typically come with tenors of up to 10 years at interest rates generally below 1 percent a year, two banking sources said.Such low costs were determined by the credit quality of the borrower, a sovereign entity, and the structure of ECA-backed deals in which the agencies take part of the risk.But it also indicated the readiness of banks to accept lower returns ahead of the IPO, the sources said.Saudi Aramco has invited banks pitching for roles in its stock market listing, including Citi and Goldman Sachs, to meetings in the kingdom in coming weeks to make their case, banking sources told Reuters this month.",pos
"* Russian condensate output rises with gas production* OPEC doesn’t include condensate in its calculations* Saudi needs Russia for cut extension deal amid Aramco IPO ZhdannikovMOSCOW/LONDON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Russia is likely to call on fellow oil producers to change the way Moscow’s output is measured when most of the world’s biggest oil-producing nations meet next month in Vienna, Russian and OPEC sources say.For three years OPEC and non-OPEC nations have curbed oil output in order to balance the market and support prices, but Russia has been measuring its production differently to the others.Unlike Saudi Arabia and other OPEC producers, Russia has been including condensate - a high-premium light type of crude oil mainly extracted during gas production - in its crude oil production numbers.In the past this has caused no problems for Moscow, but with Russia launching new gas fields in the Arctic and East Siberia and opening a new gas pipeline to China, its gas condensate production is rising.That means it is not complying with its quota under the pact reached by OPEC and non-OPEC producers, something it is keen to avoid, according to Russian and OPEC sources.“Russia will definitely escalate the condensate issue at the December meeting as its production will be growing,” one of the sources familiar with the Russian position said.OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers are scheduled to meet in Vienna on Dec 5-6.The sources didn’t say whether Russia would make other agreements with OPEC conditional to OPEC agreeing to changing Moscow’s quota such as extending their oil production cuts to next year or deepening them.However, the debate could further complicate the meeting of OPEC and allies, known as OPEC+, which is already set to coincide with Saudi Aramco’s share offering.“The whole idea about excluding condensate came out because of a rise in gas output in Russia and hence an increase in associated gas condensate production,” said a second source familiar with the Russian position, adding Russia was bound to raise the issue.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday the OPEC+ meeting may discuss adjusting oil output quotas, but did not elaborate. The Russian energy ministry did not respond to a request for comment.NEW FIELDSRussia launched a large East Siberian field in September to feed its new gas pipeline to China. Russian gas pipeline export monopoly Gazprom, which supplies a third of Europe’s gas, also faces higher demand from Europe during winter.As Gazprom supplies European customers with near record volumes this winter, it is forced to produce more condensate.“It is difficult to achieve higher output of gas without increasing output of condensate. So essentially, condensate is coming from our gas, not from our oil industry. If you try to reduce condensate production while boosting gas output, it badly affects the fields profile,” the second source said.Russia has been cutting its crude oil production in tandem with OPEC since 2017 to help support prices at around $50-$70 per barrel despite booming U.S. production.For 2019, Russia agreed to reduce its oil output by 228,000 barrels per day (bpd) to around 11.18 million bpd as part of overall cuts by the OPEC+ group of producers of 1.2 million bpd or 1.2% of global demand.However, Russia’s output this year has averaged 11.25 million bpd, meaning it is overproducing by about 70,000 bpd, Reuters calculations show.Most of the overproduction relates to gas condensate, with output of it increasing by 4% in January-October 2019 to around 770,000 bpd, Russian energy data show.Gazprom and Russia’s second largest gas producer, Novatek , account for most of the increase.By comparison, the UAE produces some 700,000 bpd of condensate while Saudi Arabia and Nigeria each produce around 400,000 bpd.(Additional reporting by Olga Yagova in Moscow, Rania el Gamal in Dubai and Alex Lawler and Ahmad Ghaddar in London; writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Jason Neely)",neg
"The New York Stock Exchange has emerged as the front-runner for the global IPO of Saudi Aramco — widely predicted to be the biggest initial public offering in history. But political, regulatory and legal challenges may discourage Riyadh from pursuing a U.S. listing, despite the commercial merits.On the surface, the Trump administration appears to have reset relations with Saudi Arabia after the Kingdom announced a $200 billion investment program during deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to Washington earlier this month.Riyadh called the meeting a “historical turning point” in U.S.-Saudi relations, and while that bodes well for stronger commercial ties in general, political perceptions, stringent U.S. disclosure rules and 2016 legislation allowing 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia may stand in the way.The New York Stock Exchange declined to comment when contacted by CNBC about the planned the Saudi Aramco IPO.A NYSE listing would be “too legally and politically risky,” said Robin Mills, CEO of Qamar Energy and a former Shell executive, adding that the most likely outcome for a global Aramco listing would involve London, Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul stock market and possibly an Asian exchange.“They (Aramco) seem to be creating a beauty parade and talking to everyone,” said Fereidun Fesharaki, founder and chairman, of Facts Global Energy. “New York is absolutely out due to regulatory restrictions. It is not a maybe, it is definite.”An international stock market listing means opening up its books to regulators — and ultimately to greater investor scrutiny. That would be a first for any Saudi state-owned behemoth, none of which are accustomed to sharing information about financial accounts and oil reserves. Some doubt Riyadh would be prepared to meet such transparency demands, despite plans to float only 5 percent of Aramco.“The Aramco IPO is a great PR stunt,” said Gal Luft, co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, a Washington-based think tank focused on energy security.“How can one establish a valuation for a company that has thus far kept its reserve data a state secret? Tearing a 5 percent piece of the company and throwing it into the market while the other 95 percent is a black box will not fly with prudent investors.”Aramco has appointed international auditors to independently assess its massive oil reserves, in a process that’s expected to be completed by the end of the year. The result of that audit — and whether it undershoots or overshoots the official Saudi figure of over 261 billion barrels — will have a direct impact on the all-important valuation and could influence the choice of where the listing takes place.Firms that list in New York are also required to go through a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission audit. On balance, a key issue for Saudi Aramco’s New York considerations “is having to reconcile to its extensive reporting and disclosure requirements,” said one former investment banker.Additionally, the continued political and diplomatic fallout from the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks stands to complicate the picture further.Saudi Arabia has denied longstanding suspicions that elements linked to Riyadh backed the hijackers who attacked the U.S. in 2001. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals.The U.S. Congress on September 28 overrode President Barack Obama’s veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, which made it possible for victims’ families to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.At least seven lawsuits alleging Saudi government support and funding for the 9/11 attacks have landed in federal courts in the six months since Congress opened the door to such litigation over the fierce opposition of Obama, NBC reported on March 20.Such unwanted legal attention may dissuade Riyadh from a U.S. listing, one banker said. “New York is less likely because of the JASTA action. New York … is a bit of a risky option.”Ultimately, Aramco and the global exchanges will be betting that the sheer size of the IPO, which is expected to raise up to $100 billion, will eclipse the politics, and not the other way around. Steen Jakobsen, chief economist & CIO at Saxo Bank, said Saudi Arabia’s $17.5 billion bond issue last year was a “lead indicator” for the Aramco IPO: “Politics is a concern, but the bond offering shows the capital market doesn’t have a political persuasion.”Alastair Newton, a political analyst and former British diplomat, added: “The problem with equity is that it is higher profile than bonds as far as the general public (in which I include Congress) is concerned.”",pos
"Until recently, Saudi Arabia tantalized investors with a plan to float its mammoth oil and gas company’s initial public offering on an international exchange — then left them deflated after it shelved the idea.For now, Saudi Aramco will only be listed on the Tadawul, the country’s domestic exchange. However, global investors have taken heart from a little noticed change from the FTSE global equity index series, a major market benchmark that in March classified Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange as a “secondary emerging” market. The FTSE’s move — which officially makes Saudi Arabia’s domestic market a benchmark available to global investors — coincided with an international charm offensive launched by the kingdom’s powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. It also marked a significant milestone on the prince’s quest to diversify Saudi Arabia’s oil-reliant economy and gives investors a backdoor to park cash in the country.“The FTSE inclusion means that Saudi has technically met the standards required for [emerging market] investors from a trading and operational perspective,” said Asha Mehta, portfolio manager and head of emerging and frontier market strategy with Acadian Asset Management.“This is a major development, given that Saudi’s equity market was closed to foreign investors just a few years ago,” Mehta said, adding that “the country’s weight could be sizable —potentially as large as Mexico or Russia.”Ahead of the Aramco floatation, the inclusion of Saudi Arabia in emerging market indexes was a development eagerly awaited by market watchers.Given historical limits to accessing the market, the country has not been included in major benchmarks prior to the FTSE classification, so the move could represent a watershed for both Saudi Arabia and investors hungry for yield.“The FTSE upgrade is important and a key reflection of the improvements in the financial plumbing that Saudi Arabia has made in recent years, but the next step to attracting equity inflows is to prove the macro story and issuance,” said Rachel Ziemba, an emerging market analyst and adjunct fellow at the Center for New American Security.“Reducing restrictions to purchase is important, but so is the macro story: growth, liquidity, and future profits, as are the flows,” she added.MSCI, another closely watched developing market index, may also weigh changes to its composition in the coming months, analysts say. Should Saudi Arabia be included, it would represent another sign of international confidence in a market traditionally reserved for domestic capital.Tadawul remains the only entity authorized in Saudi Arabia to act as the kingdom’s securities exchange to list on and trade in securities. With a market capitalization $466 billion, Tadawul ranks 25th out of 68 of the largest members of the World Federation of Exchanges.The potential of an Aramco float looms large, with Saudi Arabia set to grab 75 percent of the value traded, making it the most dominant market across the Gulf region.Mideast observers are fairly certain an Aramco IPO will happen, but a delay could work in Saudi Arabia’s favor, they say. With oil now ticking higher, it presents an opportunity for the country to balance its budget and help the kingdom push for a higher valuation for Aramco.Still, for several reasons, some argue that Saudi Arabia has a long way to go to become a top destination for investor capital.“While inclusion in the FTSE and MSCI indices would be positive for investor sentiment, we caution that [Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority] would need to consolidate these confidence gains to attract regional IPOs,” said Raphaele Auberty, a country risk analyst with London-based BMI research.While an international listing for Aramco hasn’t been entirely ruled out, market watchers have their doubts. One of the biggest questions that had always swirled around a potential foreign listing was how compliant Saudi officials — and by extension Aramco — would be about Western standards of governance and disclosure.“Since an IPO would also mean that Saudi Aramco would have to reveal a good deal of proprietary information about its operations and maintain transparency standards, there will be natural resistance to an IPO unless it is absolutely necessary,” said Indranil Ghosh, CEO of Tiger Hill Capital.“In order to list Saudi Aramco, the government will need to disclose … strategic information. Reluctance to do so could threaten the IPO,” Auberty added, noting additional pressure from insufficient domestic liquidity and competition from other established regional exchanges like Dubai’s.",pos
"The absence of Jamie Dimon from Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Summit should not be seen as a sign that Saudi Aramco’s upcoming Initial Public Offering (IPO) is in some kind of trouble, the CEO for the Middle East and Africa at Deutsche Bank told CNBC Tuesday.Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, plans to list its shares on the Saudi domestic stock market — the Tadawul — and one or more foreign exchanges in the second half of 2018. However, JPMorgan boss, Jamie Dimon, was notable in his absence from Riyadh’s so-called ” in the desert” event this week.When asked whether it should worry investors that a major CEO from one of the lead underwriters for the Saudi Aramco’s IPO was missing from the conference in Riyadh Tuesday, Deutsche Bank’s Jamal Al Kishi said: “I think that interpreting that as a sign that the process is derailed or in some kind of trouble is probably a bridge too far in my view.”Reportedly, Saudi Aramco has appointed JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and HSBC to assist with its mammoth IPO next year.On Monday, Saudi Aramco’s chief executive Amin Nasser told CNBC the plan to take a portion of the oil giant’s business public in 2018 remained on track.Al Kishi said there would be “no reason to doubt” Nasser’s comments, before adding, “If there were complications, those will be dealt with and that’s natural for a company the size of Saudi Aramco.”",pos
"Saudi Arabia expects to unveil by the end ofJune rules to prevent large share price drops in newly-listed companies, the final regulatory step for the listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco, the head of the kingdom’s stock market regulator said.The mechanism, known as price stabilization, is common on developed markets and allows underwriters of an initial public offering (IPO) to use some of the company’s stock to bolster its price, should it fall in the days after it starts trading, or the volume of shares changing hands is weak.  The kingdom has been overhauling its stock market rules to prepare for the local listing of state-owned Aramco, which is hoping to raise $100 billion or more through a 5 percent stake sale later this year.  Saudi authorities have also said they want Aramco, whose IPO is billed as the world’s largest, to have an international listing, although no decision has been made on the location. This listing could be delayed until Aramco starts trading on the Tadawul, as the Saudi stock exchange is known.  The Capital Market Authority (CMA) issued updated rules in the last couple of months covering how securities are sold in the kingdom and how the offer price of an IPO is calculated using the bookbuild method, Mohammed El Kuwaiz,chairman of the market regulator, told a media event in New York late Wednesday.  “Once (the price stabilization guideline) is issued, we can then say that the Saudi market will be fully amenable to accommodate an offering of the size of Saudi Aramco, or indeed of any size,” he said.  Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the event, El Kuwaiz said drafting of the regulation was at “an advanced stage”, and it will be issued before the end of the first half of the year.  The CMA was also expecting to start work by the end of the year on rules governing dual-listings on the Saudi stock market that would be sent out for market feedback early in 2019, El Kuwaiz said.  The timetable could be brought forward if a company approached it wanting to list on another market, he added.",pos
"Saudi Aramco may consider spinning off its growing downstream division, which includes oil refining assets, a business where the oil giant is investing heavily to meet rising fuel demand in Asia, strategists said.Aramco must first complete its planned acquisition of a strategic stake in Saudi petrochemical maker SABIC before deciding whether to list its downstream business. No decision has been made and Saudi Aramco declined to comment on what it called “rumors or speculation.”Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, is 70 percent owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s top sovereign wealth fund. It has a market capitalization of 385.2 billion Saudi riyals ($103 billion).“The first step will be completing the acquisition of the 70 percent of SABIC held by PIF and integrating that into Aramco’s petrochemical operations. That will be a lengthy and complicated business given the size of SABIC,” said Robin Mills, CEO of Qamar Energy, and a former Shell executive.“After that, yes, there could be an offering of additional stock in a merged downstream unit either on Tadawul (Saudi’s stock exchange) or an international exchange,” Mills said. “This would sidestep many of the concerns on listing the full company over transparency, reserves, political exposure, sensitivity to oil price, country exposure and the large size of the unit.”Restructuring the Aramco listing along those lines may make it more appealing to potential investors who have voiced skepticism about the transparency of the kingdom’s crude oil reserves, the long-term viability of the oil industry and the balance between investor and Saudi national priorities.The recent sell-off in benchmark oil prices is also bound to raise questions about Aramco’s ability to meet the target valuation of $2 trillion.“Perhaps a creative solution can be found whereby Aramco’s operating business and their commodity reserves are separated and listed or treated separately,” said Bryan Goh, chief investment officer at Bordier & Cie, a private bank in Singapore.Despite the setbacks to the IPO’s timeline, the state oil giant is moving ahead with multibillion-dollar projects in China, India and Malaysia and aims to finalize new partnerships this year, Abdulaziz al-Judaimi, Aramco’s senior vice president for downstream, told Reuters in June.Aramco plans to raise its refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels per day, from some 5 million bpd currently, and double its petrochemicals production by 2030, Judaimi said.Some analysts argue that splitting the business risks depriving Aramco of the competitive advantage an integrated business has to offer.“Selling the downstream assets separately does not necessarily make business sense since the integration is part of the value creation proposition offered by Aramco as an energy conglomerate,” said Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa at Eurasia Group.A public listing of Aramco’s downstream business would need “a huge shift in mindset,” said Suzanne Minter, director of energy solutions at S&P Global Platts.“What makes the Saudi [Aramco] IPO attractive in my mind is the fact that the best refineries in the world are integrated with ‘free’ oil … so they get to capture all pieces of the value chain as margins move up and down that chain,” Minter said. “If you remove that integration, and demand for refined slows, then I think you lose advantage.”— Reuters contributed to this report.",pos
"Oil giant Saudi Aramco has asked JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to assist with its upcoming mammoth IPO and could call on another bank with access to Chinese investors, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.The U.S. banks have joined boutique investment bank Moelis in being tapped for coveted roles in what is expected to be the world’s biggest initial public offering worth some $100 billion.HSBC has emerged as the leading contender for a role among a list of five banks that could provide a pipeline to Chinese investors — an important part of the offering, the source said, adding that the other four are Chinese banks.The final lineup for banks could still be adjusted, the source said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.The IPO is the centerpiece of the Saudi government’s ambitious plan, known as Vision 2030, to diversify the economy beyond oil. Up to 5 percent of the world’s largest oil producer is likely to be listed on both the Saudi stock exchange in Riyadh and on one or more international markets.Aramco, formally known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., declined to comment, as did JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC had been selected as lead underwriters.Citigroup was also among those asked to pitch for an advisory position with Aramco, Saudi-based industry sources said last month.The IPO plan has been championed by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the country’s energy and economic policies. Last year, he said he expected the IPO would value Aramco at a minimum of $2 trillion, and that the figure might end up being higher.Saudi Arabia is considering two options for the shape of Aramco when it sells shares in the national oil giant next year: either a global industrial conglomerate or a specialized international oil company, industry and banking sources have told Reuters.Saudi Aramco has also appointed international law firm White & Case, which has a long-established relationship with the state oil giant, as legal adviser for its IPO, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this month.Saudi Arabia is favoring New York to list Saudi Aramco, while also considering London and Toronto, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.The oil giant also held discussions with the Singapore Exchange regarding a potential secondary listing, sources have said.

"Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest energy company, is fully prepared for a hotly anticipated public share offering in the second half of 2018, says Aramco president and CEO Amin Nasser.It is just waiting for one thing, says Nasser. The green light from its sole shareholder: the Saudi government.“In terms of readiness, we are ready. As we always said, the company by the second half of 2018 will be ready,” Nasser told CNBC in an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The sale of roughly 5 percent of Aramco is expected to value the company at $1 to $2 trillion, making it the largest initial public offering ever. The IPO is the cornerstone of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to create the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund and diversify Saudi Arabia’s oil-dependent economy.But rumors about delays to the share sale have long swirled, fueled by the slow drip of information on key aspects of the IPO, including where the shares will be listed.“It is all depending on the shareholder’s decisions where to list because we need to coordinate with the other markets when the decision is made,” Nasser said.“So from our side as a company, we are ready by the second half of this year, and the rest is on the shareholder’s hands,” he said.Asked whether that means the Saudi government is not ready for the IPO, Nasser said it’s not about being ready.“It’s about evaluating all the information that is being passed to the government in terms of different markets that we have in terms of listed venues, whether it is in the UK, or New York or Hong Kong or other markets,” he said.“They are taking their time, rightfully so, to decide which market to list on, and when the decision is made, the company is ready to march.”Nasser said Aramco still plans to list shares on at least one foreign stock exchange, despite reports that it may only trade on Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul exchange.The IPO is complicated because Aramco underwrites the finances of the kingdom. Investors have wondered how much light the Saudi government will shed on its oil reserves and the future viability of its fossil fuels business.There are also questions about how Saudi Arabia will balance the national priorities and social welfare spending, funded by oil revenues, with Aramco’s duty to shareholders as a public company.Nasser told CNBC in an interview last year he believes the priorities of the Saudi government and Aramco’s future shareholders will be in alignment.Programming note: More of Andrew Ross Sorkin’s interview with Amin Nasser will air Wednesday morning on “Squawk Box.”",pos
"Moelis & Co has won the advisory mandate for the planned initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, according to three people familiar with the process, scoring the New York independent firm the biggest equity advisory mandate in history.Winning the hotly contested mandate represents a coup for the boutique investment bank, which was founded by Ken Moelis in the midst of the financial crisis in 2007.Saudi officials hope to turn the state-owned oil group into the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, which they believe could carry a valuation of about $2 trillion.More from the Financial Times:  Saudi Aramco gets ready for ‘no ordinary IPO’   UAE’s relationship with Taliban questioned after Afghanistan bomb Brazilian airline Azul files for IPO (yes, again) Those close to the IPO planning have said the sale of a 5 percent stake should happen next year, although the number of shares sold could increase, and the timing could slip.The IPO proposal is the centrepiece of an ambitious strategy by the hard-charging deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to overhaul the country’s economy, using a broad-based privatisation programme to boost employment and diversify the kingdom away from oil.Riyadh hopes to use the IPO proceeds for investments in non-oil industries in order to wean the country off its most precious resource. Banks, advisory firms and consultancies have scrambled to secure work on the IPO since Saudi officials announced their intention a year ago.JPMorgan, which has been Saudi Aramco’s commercial banker for years, and Michael Klein, a former star Citigroup banker, are working with the Saudi authorities on a broad range of matters including the IPO. Other banks have provided informal advice to the company on the prospective IPO and have made several visits to Saudi Arabia in an attempt to get a slice of the action.Moelis declined to comment, and Saudi Aramco did not immediately respond to requests for commentIt would be no ordinary listing for advisory firms and banks overseeing the selling of shares in the group that supplies one in every nine barrels of oil produced in the world. The offering would be complicated largely due to how entwined Saudi Aramco, the kingdom’s biggest revenue generator, is with the state. Besides managing vast oil reserves, it acts on behalf of the government constructing schools, hospitals and sports stadiums.In preparation for the IPO, Saudi Aramco has sought advice on matters ranging from which exchange to list on, regulatory exposure, disclosure rules and dividend policy.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",pos
"Saudi Aramco’s CEO has told CNBC its long-awaited plan to sell shares in the oil giant will happen, but he doesn’t expect it until at least 2021.The initial public offering (IPO) of the state-controlled firm is a stated aim of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has valued the firm at more than $2 trillion.Speaking to CNBC’s Steve Sedgwick at the ADIPEC forum in Abu Dhabi, Saudi Aramco’s CEO Amin Nasser, said both the crown prince and Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Khalid al-Falih were targeting a listing within three years.“I think his royal highness and his excellency, the minister, talked about 2021. At the end of the day the government will decide when the market is good,” he said.Oil prices surged Monday after Saudi Arabia said it was cutting supply by half a million barrels per day in December. However, the bigger picture is that oversupply concerns have seen crude prices drop hard in recent months.For the past two years, Saudi Arabia has prepared to place up to 5 percent of its national oil company on the stock market but has been reluctant to proceed amid the low-price environment. Until Monday’s price spike, the cost of a barrel of oil had endured the longest losing streak since 1984.While a soft market may not suit a listing, Nasser said a lot of analysts had overlooked the amount of background work being undertaken for the IPO.“We have a new concession agreement, the reserves were audited, the board was changed, there was a new tax regime signed with the government. There are a lot of reforms happening to list Saudi Aramco,” he added.The state oil giant recently announced the purchase of a majority stake in SABIC, a Saudi state-controlled chemicals and materials group. Aramco’s plan is to shift some sales of crude oil to petrochemicals and diversify more toward the downstream market.Nasser said while SABIC was an obvious strategic fit, the purchase would naturally delay any listing of Aramco.Saudi Arabia’s image has taken a battering in recent weeks, following the unexplained death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.Nasser brushed aside any suggestion that recent geopolitical events might have dented investor appetite in Saudi Aramco.“During FII (Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative investment forum), we signed $34 billion of deals with our partners, so the appetite is there,” he said.",neg

There are serious discussions with the New York Stock Exchange about having the NYSE be one of the exchanges for the Aramco IPO and I believe the decision will be made on the financial merits,” Adel al-Jubeir told Fox News.",neg
"As confusion surrounding the world’s largest IPO builds, many market players are hoping for further clarification from authorities.Excitement about the international initial public offering of state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Company, or Saudi Aramco, was sky high last year as investors saw the development as a sign that Riyadh was finally getting serious about reducing its oil dependency. Fast forward to present day, and speculation is abounding that such a listing may be indefinitely postponed.Saudi Arabia could use an upcoming conference by sovereign wealth fund the Public Investment Fund to shed more light on the matter, said Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa practice at political consultancy Eurasia Group.“Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will address the Future Investment Summit organized in Riyadh this month and could use the occasion to elaborate on the government’s plans,” he wrote in a recent note.The summit, which runs from Oct. 24 to Oct. 26, is expected to draw several global business leaders and asset managers such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.Rumors circulated last week that the Kingdom, led by King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince bin Salman, could scrap plans for a 2018 international listing and opt for a private share placement instead, according to last week’s Financial Times report. Khalid Al-Falih, the country’s energy minister and Aramco’s chairman, has dismissed those claims, telling CNBC that progress was being made for the firm’s international debut.But some strategists still remain skeptical.“One thing I’m very confident of is that [officials] don’t know what they’re going to do yet,” said Kamran Bokhari, a senior analyst with intelligence firm Geopolitical Futures as well as a senior fellow at the Center for Global Policy. “To me, it sounds like they don’t have their house in order.”Aramco, the biggest oil producer on the planet, is expected no matter what to debut shares on the Saudi exchange — the Tadawul — next year.“The latest rhetoric from Saudi oil minister points to the fact that the review is still ongoing and with the stakes of this decision, I am inclined to think that this may remain the type of soundbites for the market until a decision has been made,” said Jingyi Pan, market strategist at IG.Many believe Riyadh won’t completely desert the idea of an international IPO given its significance to the nation’s economic transformation program, known as Vision 2030.Crown Prince bin Salman “would find it difficult to walk away from his commitment to increase transparency in Aramco and the kingdom,” Eurasia’s Kamel said, adding that he expects a private placement to be “a precursor, not a replacement” for a secondary listing.Launched last year, Vision 2030 aims to diversify Saudi Arabia’s state revenue away from energy, but progress remains slow, sparking doubts over the initiative’s feasibility. Non-oil GDP growth in 2017 is expected to be weaker compared to the first part of the decade due to lower oil prices and fiscal consolidation, Khatija Haque, head of Middle East and North Africa research at banking group Emirates NBD, wrote in a note earlier this month.Postponing the IPO from 2018 to 2019 could make sense for Riyadh: It would not only provide the government with more flexibility to list when oil prices strengthen, it could also support the succession process and equip the king-in-waiting with political gains, Kamel said.But Bokhari said it’s entirely possible for an international offering to remain on hold: “It seems like one of those things they floated just to see what kind of response they would get.” A key reason for an international IPO was raising non-oil sources of revenue, so officials might just be satisfied with a private sale, he continued.In addition to timing, location also remains an unknown — exchanges in New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong have been raised as contenders to host Aramco’s shares.",pos
"Charles Li, the CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), said access to Chinese capital and China’s role as the world’s largest importer of oil made Hong Kong a viable contender in the frantic race between listing venues.Chinese banks are also expected to play a part. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China International and China International Capital Corporation (CICC) are among the Chinese banks pitching for an advisory role. “For an IPO of that scale, it makes perfect sense to potentially be accessible by the very large capital base and investment wealth onshore in China,” Li told reporters during an earnings briefing, adding it also made sense for Aramco to have a listing in Asia.He said the Hong Kong stock exchange has had discussions with Aramco and is working “very hard” to snag what is expected to be the world’s biggest ever IPO. He gave no details on any of the concessions Hong Kong is expected to make for the deal.Li’s comments come as Saudi Arabia’s King Salman on Sunday kicked-off a month-long Asia tour to promote investment and court investors for the IPO. The monarch is visiting Malaysia, Indonesia, Japan and China. Saudi authorities plan to list up to 5 percent of the world’s largest oil producer on the Saudi stock exchange in Riyadh, the Tadawul, and also one or more international markets, potentially raising as much as $100 billion. One source familiar with the pitching process confirmed Asia was being considered by Aramco as a listing venue.With a focus on China’s wealth and its strategic importance to Saudi Arabia - the kingdom is among the biggest suppliers of crude to China - the HKEX is seen as having an edge over potential Asian rival bourses in the race to bag the giant IPO.The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which has made efforts to woo Aramco, according to two sources, has less liquidity than Hong Kong and has seen foreign companies steadily delist over the past decade with only a handful of foreign listings remaining.The Singapore Exchange is also keen to get a piece of the Aramco IPO pie, sources have said, but would again face numerous challenges given its smaller size. The Hong Kong bourse, the world’s No.1 IPO market in 2015 and 2016, famously lost the record $25 billion IPO of Chinese Alibaba Group Holding to New York because it could not offer the ecommerce giant dual-class shares.Again here, some listing rules in Hong Kong would have to be circumvented if HKEX is to clinch Aramco’s IPO, according to one person involved in pitching Hong Kong to the oil giant.Currently, the rules do not allow companies to list less than 15 percent of their total number of issued shares, while Saudi is also not currently an accepted jurisdiction of incorporation for Hong Kong listed entities. A secondary listing could also be tricky since HKEX does not currently recognize Saudi’s Tadawul as a legitimate primary listing venue.Regulatory sources said the exchange does have discretion over how the rules are applied and is able to grant waivers in special circumstances as it did in the case of some Chinese bank listings. Russia’s Rusal was also able to create a Jersey-incorporated entity in order to raise $2.2 billion through its Hong Kong IPO in 2010, they added.“Even so, I think the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will have issues with the lack of disclosure around Aramco,” said one of the sources involved in pitching a Hong Kong listing. “This could set the HKEX up for another clash with the SFC.”HKEX’s Li did not respond to a question on the regulatory challenges the IPO could pose for the exchange.The SFC declined to comment. Aramco did not immediately respond to a Reuters query for comment.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",pos
"The chief executive of Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange told CNBC Wednesday that it is well-placed to cope with the pressures of the world’s largest ever initial public offering (IPO).Saudi Arabia recently shelved plans to sell a 5 percent stake in state-owned energy giant Aramco, reportedly amid valuation and regulatory concerns. Nonetheless, the IPO remains critical to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious plan to overhaul the kingdom’s economy.So far, Saudi Arabia’s stock market — also known as Tadawul — is the only confirmed listing exchange for Aramco.“I think the Saudi stock exchange will continue to develop its markets to be ready for Aramco and other issues,” Khalid Al Hussan, who heads the exchange, told CNBC’s “Street Signs” on Wednesday.Saudi Arabia hopes to attract a $2 trillion valuation for Aramco — the world’s largest oil company — though some external observers have pegged its value at half that amount.Amin Nasser, CEO of Aramco, told CNBC earlier this year that his company was prepared for a public offering in the second half of 2018, but was waiting for the government to choose an exchange. Indecision over the listing venue is widely thought to have snarled the process.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange will introduce exchange-traded derivatives in the first half of 2019. On Tuesday, global index provider MSCI said it had reached a deal with Tadawul to jointly launch a tradeable index.An exchange traded derivative is a financial instrument that trades on a regulated exchange and whose value is based on the value of another asset.“The benefit is basically to offer more diversified products, specifically to institutional investors,” Hussan said, before adding, “the inflow of capital depends on how attractive we are and that is basically why we are accelerating the derivatives.”The announcement of a tradeable index comes after MSCI officially classified Saudi Arabia’s equity market as an emerging market in June. Riyadh’s inclusion on the emerging market index is widely expected to attract billions of dollars of passive funds.Saudi Arabia has launched a flurry of market reforms in recent years, as part of a broader effort to encourage direct investment into the kingdom from foreign institutions. The Middle-Eastern country has also eased restrictions on foreign ownership of companies.The reforms have attracted some of the world’s largest money managers to invest directly in Saudi Arabia’s equity market, including BlackRock, HSBC and Citigroup.",pos

"Saudi Aramco's planned initial public offering remains on track, the company said on Thursday, after Bloomberg reported that the oil company is preparing contingency plans for a possible delay by a few months into 2019.Saudi authorities are aiming to list up to 5 percent of the world's largest oil producer on both the Saudi stock exchange in Riyadh, the Tadawul, and one or more international markets in an IPO that could raise $100 billion.""The initial public offering of a stake in Saudi Aramco remains on track,"" said Aramco in an email.""The IPO process is well under way and Saudi Aramco remains focused on ensuring that all IPO related work is completed to the very highest standards on time.""Bloomberg reported on Wednesday the Saudi government is still aiming for the IPO of the state-owned oil giant in the second half of 2018, but that the timetable is getting increasingly tight for what is likely to be the biggest share sale in history.Aramco has still not chosen an international venue for the listing although New York and London are seen as leading contenders.

"(Adds details on banks in deal)Nov 21 (Reuters) - China's Alibaba will pay its investment banking syndicate up to $32.3 million for leading its Hong Kong listing which will raise up to $12.9 billion, according to documents filed with U.S. securities regulators.The e-commerce giant employed two co-sponsors, China International Capital Corp (CICC) and Credit Suisse, to head the deal which has been carried out over the past week.The two lead banks were joined by Citigroup Inc, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley as joint global co-ordinators while HSBC and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) were appointed as junior book runners.An additional supplementary prospectus lodged with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed Alibaba would pay investment banking fees of $28.1 million for the sale of 500 million shares.This would rise to $32.3 million if a so-called overallotment of an additional 75 million shares is issued, which bankers think will occur.The fee split between the banks was not listed in the SEC documents but it is accepted industry practice that co-sponsors are paid the most and the remaining banks' fees are dependent on the amount of shares sold.According to the filings, Citigroup was allotted more shares to sell than JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley as bookrunners.A Hong Kong brokerage part-owned by Alibaba founder, Yunfeng Securities, was also listed as being a participant in the deal.The investment banks will also benefit from the 1 per cent brokerage fee paid by investors buying stock in the secondary listing.Alibaba's payment to banks sits well below the $90m check that Saudi Arabia's Aramco intends to write for the banks working on its slimmed down initial public offering (IPO).The highest ever fee payment on a deal was Visa's 2008 IPO in New York which raised $19.6 billion and led to the company paying its banks $550.2 million, according to Dealogic data,Alibaba's Hong Kong stock is due to start trading next Tuesday.($1 = 7.8249 Hong Kong dollars) (Reporting by Scott Murdoch; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Richard Pullin)",pos
"Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, is walking back plans for a massive public share offering on an international exchange.Aramco is now expected to list public shares on the Saudi domestic stock market, perhaps as soon as the second half of this year, according to sources familiar with the situation. But a potential international listing is now expected to come later, if at all, the sources said.The initial public offering of Saudi Aramco in a city such as New York or London was expected to be the largest ever share listing. But plans to list on a major foreign stock exchange have been delayed as Aramco grapples with the challenges of taking the company public.Currently, there is no international listing planned, but sources said Aramco continues to hope it will list in a foreign financial center some time next year.“The Company continues to review options for the listing,” Saudi Aramco said in a statement after the news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.“In addition to listing on Tadawul, the home exchange, a range of international options are still being held under active review. The Company will not provide a running commentary on the course of the IPO.”Sources said the Aramco listing will be much smaller than anticipated in the international market, and that an Asian cornerstone investor is likely to participate. A big investment in Aramco by China’s sovereign wealth fund has long been rumored, but never confirmed by the Saudis.“Asian sovereign wealth funds have always been in the mix. There’s no reason for them to close the door to London or new York, but they could have figured the prudent path was to do it in Riyadh first,” one market source said. “There are many ways to define an IPO.”An international listing of Aramco was seen as the centerpiece of the powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to reshape the Saudi economy and reduce the nation’s reliance on oil revenues. It was seen valuing Aramco at $1 trillion to $2 trillion and raising about $100 billion to underwrite an expansion of the kingdom’s public investment fund.A rebound in oil prices following the 2014 collapse of the crude market has somewhat curbed the need for such a large IPO, sources told the Wall Street Journal.One factor favoring the idea of first listing locally is the anticipated award in June of emerging market status for Saudi Arabia by index firm MSCI. That designation could bring a wave of foreign capital into the local market next year as global fund managers add Saudi Arabia to their holdings.Still, the market capitalization of the entire Saudi stock exchange is under $500 billion.The money that flows from Aramco’s oil wells to state coffers is the linchpin of a social contract between the ruling royal family and average Saudis. Investors long questioned how Aramco would balance that contract with its citizens, who have come to depend on generous social spending, with its responsibility to shareholders post-IPO.A listing on the New York Stock Exchange has long raised concerns about litigation risks.  Family members of those killed in the World Trade Center attack on Sept. 11 have long sought to press a legal case against Saudi officials, alleging they shielded some of the attackers.Earlier this year, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC his company was ready to go public, but was waiting for its sole shareholder, the Saudi government, to decide on an international listing venue.",pos
"* Yngve Slyngstad has been CEO since 2008* He has overseen five-fold increase in fund’s value* Announces 1.6% return on investment in third quarter* Says fund will not invest in Saudi Aramco IPO (Recasts with CEO resignation)OSLO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The chief executive of Norway’s sovereign wealth fund announced on Wednesday he will step down after nearly 12 years, saying just days after the fund hit a record value that it was a good time for a leadership change.Reporting a 1.6% return on investment in the third quarter, Yngve Slyngstad also told a news conference that the fund does not plan to invest in Saudi Aramco when the oil company carries out its long-awaited initial public offering (IPO).Slyngstad, 56, has been with the fund for 22 years and has held the top job since January 2008. He invested heavily during the stock market meltdown soon afterwards and has overseen a fivefold rise in asset values while in charge.He will take up a new job with the fund, based in London, where he will build a unit to invest in “unlisted infrastructure projects” such as wind power and other renewable energy.The leadership change is likely to be “in a few quarters”, he said.“I’m not leaving, I’m taking a different role in the fund. I think it’s a good time for the leadership change,” Slyngstad told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference. “Any day is an arbitrary day, but why not at this stage, when everything is aligned both in terms of the strategy and the size of the fund.”The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, which saves revenues from Norway’s oil and gas industry for future generations, last Friday hit a record value of 10 trillion Norwegian crowns ($1.08 trillion).But the fund has at times met political resistance, including over moves to diversify away from oil - parliament rejected its 2017 proposal to divest all oil and gas stocks.In the end, the initiative was watered down to only include a sale of pure-play upstream explorers, leaving integrated oil majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell in the portfolio.Slyngstad said the interference was not a reason for his resignation.“No, we have a clear mandate from the Ministry of Finance, it’s very well defined what our role is. It’s well defined by the board of how we are going to execute the strategy plans which update regularly, so my role first of all is execution,” he said.Finance Minister Siv Jensen said in a statement to Reuters: “He has done a tremendous job, delivering results that will benefit us all for a long, long time.”Central bank Governor Oeystein Olsen, who will lead the process of recruiting a replacement, said political interference comes with the job.“I think it’s a strength to operate that kind of fund in a democracy with our kind of politicians. They’ve made good decisions over the years, and deserve credit for the overall management of the fund,” Olsen said.THIRD-QUARTER BOOSTED BY U.S. INVESTMENTSThe fund made a 1.6% return on investment in the third quarter, earning 236 billion Norwegian crowns ($25.55 billion), it said earlier.“Equity and fixed income investments had another quarter with positive returns,” Slyngstad said. “We saw a particularly positive contribution from U.S. treasuries and North American stocks, which returned 4.6% and 2.9% respectively.”The return for the quarter was in line with the fund’s benchmark index, it said.With a population of less than 5.4 million, the Norwegian fund’s quarterly return works out at almost $4,800 per citizen.It invests Norway’s oil and gas revenue in foreign stocks, bonds and real estate, but investment in Saudi Aramco is not in its sights.“Saudi Arabia is not part of our reference index,” Slyngstad said.The fund has some smaller investments in Saudi companies through an emerging markets portfolio, but a major company such as Aramco would not be a natural part of this portfolio, he said.The fund’s largest fixed-income holdings are in U.S. government bonds.It owns stakes in more than 9,000 companies globally, with its biggest holdings in tech giants Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc, followed by Switzerland’s Nestle SA , Google parent firm Alphabet Inc and Amazon Inc.

"Britain’s markets watchdog will press ahead with a new premium listing next month aimed at attracting companies like state-controlled Saudi Aramco to London, although the rules have been “refined” following investor criticism.The Financial Conduct Authority’s initial proposal last year led to suggestions the British government had influenced the watchdog to try to secure the Saudi energy company’s planned initial public offering (IPO).Saudi Arabia is expected to float up to 5 percent of Aramco in Riyadh and an international venue such as London or New York in what is expected to be the biggest ever IPO and would boost the reputation of its chosen listing venue.Britain is keen to promote London’s leading position as a financial center as it leaves the European Union but some lawmakers had questioned if the original proposal for listings by sovereign-controlled firms could weaken investor protection.The FCA said it was pressing ahead, despite criticism of its plans by major institutional investors when they were first circulated in July last year.“The FCA thinks there is considerable benefit to investors if corporate issuers agree to meet these additional premium requirements,” the watchdog said in a statement accompanying an 83-page document outlining the new rules on Friday.The FCA said it had made some changes following feedback, including the requirement that the election of independent directors be subject to approval from independent shareholders.There would also be a requirement for “timely disclosures” on transactions between the sovereign and the issuer.But there will not be a requirement for a controlling shareholder agreement, and no need for an advance sponsor opinion or advance approval by independent shareholders of certain transactions with the sovereign or its associates.“These rules mean when a sovereign controlled company lists here, investors can benefit from the protections offered by a premium listing,” FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said.The watchdog said responses to its consultation were “polarized”, with big investors mostly against, and all others generally supportive.The Investment Association, which represents big shareholders, said it was disappointed by the lack of a requirement for independent votes on the changes made. It also wants a review of the new listing category after two years to check for any unintended consequences.“We continue to oppose the inclusion of companies in this new segment in all major equity indices as this would force UK savers to invest in these companies despite the loss of valuable and hard won investor protections,” the IA’s chief executive Chris Cummings said in a statement.Nick O’Donnell, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, said that overall the FCA had stuck to its guns while central planks of corporate governance standards, such as being part of a FTSE index not being automatic, remain intact.“Although the proposal has often been linked with the possible Saudi Aramco IPO, the reality is this is much wider than that. There are a lot of other companies that have been looking at this segment,” O’Donnell said.A premium listing in London would typically require a float of at least 25 percent of a company’s shares, but the new category could allow a smaller float, the FCA said.“Some very large companies can make a credible case for a liquid market at a free float of less than 25 percent,” it said.",pos
"Hong Kong’s initial public offering (IPO) market has been hit badly by the unrest in the city, plummeting nearly 43% in proceeds year to date. But it could see a turnaround soon, analysts say.The city has “witnessed a slow period” for IPOs this year, said financial data company Refinitiv. It has raised $18.5 billion in proceeds so far, down 42.8% as compared with the same period last year, said its senior analyst Elaine Tan.The months-long protests over a now-withdrawn extradition bill have kept investors and companies away, with billions of dollars said to have been pulled out already, Reuters reported, citing a recent estimate by Goldman Sachs. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng index has tumbled since the protests began in June.Amid the turmoil, Reuters reported that Chinese giant Alibaba postponed its up to $15 billion listing. The Wall Street Journal reported Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant Saudi Aramco was said to switch its preference from Hong Kong or London to Tokyo as the international destination to list its shares.“Investor sentiment in Hong Kong is quite low as demonstrations continue as they have become smaller but more violent,” said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer of KraneShares, an investment firm known for its China-focused ETFs.“The demonstrations have had a material negative effect on the local economy as tourists avoid the city which hurts hotels, restaurants and retailers. IPOs tend to ride investor enthusiasm which is lacking in Hong Kong today,” he added.He added that AB InBev’s Budweiser APAC listing in September — the second-largest this year after Uber — bucked the trend as it tapped on investor enthusiasm for Chinese liquor and alcohol investments. It was the brewing giant’s second attempt this year after the first one failed due to what it called “several factors, including the prevailing market conditions.”But, all might not be lost. “A robust IPO pipeline is anticipated to reverse the listing drought witnessed in the last two months and continue to show Hong Kong’s resilience as one of the best venues for initial public offerings,” said Refinitiv’s Tan in an email to CNBC.She noted logistics firm ESR Cayman’s up to $1.45 billion IPO, which was pulled in June, but relaunched on Monday and set to begin trading Nov. 1. That could be Hong Kong’s second-largest listing this year, after the Budweiser IPO.Chinese sportswear retailer Topsports International also launched its IPO in October, raising $1.01 billion as it began trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange. That contributed to an uptick in Hong Kong IPOs for the month, during which 11 deals raised $1.4 billion, as compared with just six new listings in September, said Tan.Other upcoming listings in Hong Kong include financial institution Home Credit’s up to $1.5 billion IPO and Bank of Guizhou’s up to $1 billion listing.Hong Kong’s fortunes could turn around further if the U.S. really moves to place curbs on investments in China, which Washington reportedly considered amid its trade fight with Beijing. One of the measures under consideration reportedly included delisting Chinese stocks in the U.S., though the Trump administration pushed back on those reports and said it was “not contemplating” such a move at the moment.“If capital controls on Chinese companies listing in the United States were to be implemented, Hong Kong would be a major beneficiary,” said KraneShares’ Ahern.EY’s Ringo Choi said with that development, it could be a better move for Alibaba to list in Hong Kong, as it’s likely to have the added benefit of China’s backing.“If they come to Hong Kong, there’s a high chance that Chinese state-owned companies would buy into Alibaba,” Choi, EY’S APAC IPO leader, told CNBC via a phone interview.Shares of Alibaba, Baidu and other Chinese companies had plunged following those reports of possible U.S. curbs on investments in China.

"Sept 24 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is considering doubling the stake to be offered in oil giant Saudi Aramco’s much awaited initial public offering, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The Saudi Royal Court and its advisers have been debating an eventual float of as much as 10% of the Saudi Arabian Oil Co, known as Aramco, doubling the country’s longstanding public intention to list just 5%, according to the report.

"Saudi Arabia’s stock market could get a helpful boost of liquidity by its inclusion in emerging markets indexes as it looks to the anticipated IPO of state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco.The kingdom’s equities market is being considered by MSCI for emerging markets status, and was named a secondary emerging market by the FTSE Russell for its global index series.   MSCI’s announcement, a much bigger driver of emerging market funds, is due in June, and would be effective next year.“It would introduce more liquidity into the markets, and we’re talking about an IPO of a state-owned company, which would be a large contributor to the market. Anything that would make the market bigger, the pool bigger would help absorb the  IPO,” said Peter Donisanu, global market strategist at Wells Fargo.Saudi stocks will be phased in by FTSE Russell beginning in March, 2019.“People are anticipating anywhere from from $3 to $5 billion of international flows will come into the stock market prior to MSCI, FTSE inclusion. On the back of that, you have a lot of locals who are beginning also to invest in the stock market. That’s keeping up the momentum. The stock market is roughly by now about 10 percent lower than where it was the last time oil prices were at $70,” said John Sfakianakis, director of economic research at the Gulf Research Center.He said there are estimates that MSCI inclusion would bring in another $15 to $20 billion of foreign inflows. The widely held iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF is based on MSCI, and managers who use MSCI indexes would have to add Saudi shares if it is approved. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, has been in the U.S. and is visiting with government officials and business leaders, as part of his efforts to change Saudi into a more diverse, modern economy. On Tuesday evening,  the prince announced, along with Softbank, a plan to build the world’s largest solar power generation project.Sarah Al-Suhaimi, chairwoman of the bourse, or the Tadawul, told CNBC Tuesday that the exchange has been transforming itself, in areas such as clearing, in line with international standards. She was attending the Saudi-U.S. CEO forum in New York. The Aramco IPO is expected to list first on the Saudi exchange and has been targeted for 2018, though it could be later in early, 2019.On the local exchange, “they could test the waters a little bit, see what investor appetite is. If its true this FTSE and MSCI litings come through, you could have a lot more buyers at the table,” said Donisanu. He said the overall Saudi market has a market cap of about $450 billion, and the IPO listing there would have to be smaller than the $100 billion the company hopes to raise globally.The company has also been considering listing in Hong Kong, London or New York which would come after the Riyadh listing. Nishit Lakhotia, head of SICO told CNBC earlier Wednesday that he expected to see the FTSE Russell listing to be announced. “In terms of the flows, yes the market is factoring it in,” he said. Lakhotia said the passive flows from the FTSE inclusion could be about $4.5 billion, but total flows would be more.  “That’s a widely anticipated event. Everybody’s looking at that. It’s a major thing for Saudi Arabia. It’s one of the internationally accepted benchmarks and it gives MBS [Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman] additional credit for reform and change in the capital markets,” said Sfakianakis.",pos
"Britain has proposed a loosening of rules on stock market listings by state companies, just as the London Stock Exchange is trying to win the IPO of Saudi Arabian oil giant Saudi Aramco, a potentially huge but controversial prize.The new rules proposed by Britain’s financial watchdog would create a new listing category for companies controlled by sovereign states and come as exchanges around the world are vying to win the Aramco listing, which is expected to be the largest initial public offering (IPO) ever.But the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) proposals are likely to spark criticism from British fund managers, who have already expressed concerns about Aramco’s governance.British asset management body the Investment Association said in May that it was concerned that Aramco would be granted exemptions that could weaken the influence of minority shareholders.Reuters reported earlier this year that the London Stock Exchange Group was working on a new type of listing structure that would make it more attractive for Aramco to join the bourse.The proposals come as the government and City of London are trying to keep Britain’s financial markets attractive to international investors and companies after the country leaves the European Union.The FCA said on Thursday it is proposing a new “premium” stock market listing category that will exempt companies controlled by sovereign states from certain requirements.“Refining the listing regime in this way would make UK markets more accessible whilst ensuring that the protections afforded by our premium listing regime are focused and proportionate,” FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said.Bridging the GulfUnder the FCA’s proposals, sovereign-controlled companies will be able to obtain a “premium” listing on the London Stock Exchange without complying with certain rules on related party transactions and controlling shareholders.The changes are likely to make Britain’s stock market more attractive to state-controlled companies just as several Gulf countries are considering listing part of their oil assets. Aside from Saudi Arabia, Oman and Abu Dhabi have also said they might float part of their state oil businesses.At present companies which do not meet Britain’s “premium” listing requirements have to take a standard listing. These are seen as less attractive as they have lower corporate governance requirements, do not qualify for entry into most stock indices and have connotations of being second best.To qualify for a premium LSE listing at the moment, a shareholder that controls more than 30 percent of a company has to enter into a legally binding arrangement to ensure that transactions between the company and the controlling shareholder will be conducted at ‘arms length’ and on commercial terms.The listed company also has to obtain prior approval from independent shareholders before entering into a deal with a ‘related party’ with a major shareholder.The FCA said it believed controlling sovereign owners tend to act differently from private ones so it was legitimate to grant them exemption to these requirements.“Sovereign owners tend to be different from private sector individuals or entities in both their motivations and their nature,” it said in its consultation paper.“We believe that investors and the market are sufficiently able to assess the additional risks arising from sovereign ownership”.The FCA has set a deadline of Oct 13 for comment on the proposals, which are part of a wider review it is undertaking into Britain’s listing rules but were brought forward because it said it thought there was a gap in its current rules.",pos
"Saudi Aramco has received bids for more than 10 times the $10 billion it was expected to raise in a debut international bond issue, with the world’s largest oil producer due to set the price of its bonds later on Tuesday.Initially, the six-part deal had been expected to be at least $10 billion in size, but a source familiar with the situation said that orders have topped $100 billion.The first-ever debt issuance from Aramco has sparked massive global interest, with the move offering investors greater visibility into the financial performance of the world’s most profitable company. The offering comes ahead of plans to list a portion of Aramco on international stock markets in about two years.Saudi Arabia’s state-controlled energy giant is marketing a landmark U.S. dollar denominated debt issue split into six tranches, with maturities ranging from three to 30 years.“Everyone knew the size was going to be big but what is worth highlighting is that the quality is impressive — much better than the market had been expecting,” Mohieddine Kronfol, chief investment officer of Global Sukuk and MENA Fixed Income at Franklin Templeton Investments, told CNBC via telephone on Tuesday.It is a “high quality and low-risk offering” which offers market participants a chance to take a serious look at a country which has historically been underweight on investment portfolios, Kronfol said.Before opening the books on Monday, Aramco’s debut international bond sale had already attracted over $30 billion in demand, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said Monday, while speaking at the inaugural Gulf Intelligence Saudi Arabia Energy Forum in Riyadh.Market participants were thought to be so keen to buy the bonds, they were willing to risk ending up getting a lower return than on Saudi sovereign debt, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Aramco is marketing the new bonds at a price in line with Saudi government bonds.Earlier this month, Aramco received an “A+” rating from Fitch and an “A1″ rating from Moody’s in its first ever credit ratings, following 2018 earnings that dwarfed those of international oil majors.Saudi Arabia has already seen formidable success in its recent tapping of the bond market: It issued $7.5 billion in sovereign bonds in January which drew an impressive $27 billion in orders.Saudi Arabia has “A1” and “A+” ratings from agencies Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, a sign of reliability and low risk for investors.The bond issue, announced last week, is also thought to be designed to help raise funds for a down payment on the oil giant’s $69.1 billion purchase of a majority stake in Saudi petrochemicals firm Sabic.It also comes around six months after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate of Istanbul. Intelligence agencies in the U.S. have since concluded the Saudi crown prince ordered the killing of Khashoggi.Riyadh denies that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the murder.Khashoggi’s killing sparked concerns that international investors would shun the kingdom, but bond buyers do not appear ready to overlook an investment opportunity in Saudi Arabia — the world’s largest oil exporter.“It gives some impetus or renewed credibility to the reform agenda in Saudi Arabia, especially after a fairly challenging 2018,” Kronfol said.The bond sale also brings the idea of Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO) “back on the table,” he added.Aramco has postponed its long-awaited stock market debut several times and now expects to list shares in 2021. The IPO is looking to drum up cash for a government that aims to significantly reduce its budget deficit and underwrite an ambitious plan to diversify its economy beyond oil.— CNBC’s Natasha Turak  and Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.",pos
"* Flagship forum to showcase Saudi future away from oil* Diversification slow to take off as investors remain wary* More participants expected than last year’s event* Aramco IPO still biggest attractionDUBAI, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s heavy hitters are back in Saudi Arabia but the terms of engagement have changed.The CEOs of Citigroup and Credit Suisse, as well as the heads of fund managers BlackRock and BlackStone will be among those gathering in Riyadh next week for a glitzy investment conference, an event not attended by top financiers last year after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son will also attend the Oct 29-31 conference, two people familiar with the matter said, as the Japanese company seeks to raise funds for a second technology fund. The Saudi sovereign wealth fund contributed $40 billion to Softbank’s first technology fund.But the buzz around the Future Investment Initiative (FII) has faded since the conference was first launched in 2017, when it was heralded as Davos in the desert, a nod to the annual gathering of world leaders and corporate bosses in the Swiss Alps.Then, Saudi Arabia was being feted for its investment opportunities and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was hailed as a force for change.Now, fallout from Khashoggi’s killing and the stop-start process towards the long-awaited stock market listing of state-run energy giant Saudi Aramco have shifted the mood.“It’s not seen as a must-do event like Davos,” said one banker at an international bank.The country has struggled to lure foreign investment to fund projects outside the oil sector, including manufacturing, meant to create millions of jobs for Saudis, as investors hesitate over the commercial viability of projects and Riyadh’s human rights record.Proceeds from Aramco’s initial public offering will boost the Saudi wealth fund’s ability to back domestic mega-projects including the $500 billion futuristic city NEOM, announced at FII in 2017.But there has been little progress on NEOM so far other than construction of royal palaces and an airport. A NEOM company spokesman said it continues to engage with a “wide range of potential foreign and local investors”.Saudi Arabia has managed to sign some multi-billion dollar deals last year at the conference, but it was Aramco that clinched most of them.“Signing commercial agreements is great for PR, but what Saudi Arabia really needs is for many of its national development initiatives to move from the conceptual stage to implementation with foreign, private-sector partners,” said Robert Mogielnicki, resident scholar at Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute.ARAMCO’S ALLUREAramco’s IPO, for which Prince Mohammed is seeking a $2 trillion valuation, remains the biggest draw in Saudi Arabia for investors.The company was due to announce plans on Oct. 20 for an initial 1%-2% flotation on the Saudi stock market, a listing that could be the biggest ever depending on the valuation.But this has been delayed. An adviser told participating banks that Aramco wanted to wait until its third-quarter results were published to bolster investor confidence following attacks on the company’s plants last month which halved Saudi Arabia’s crude output.Sources also told Reuters more time was needed to lock in cornerstone investors for the listing.The country’s privatisation drive looks far from reaching a target of 35-40 billion riyals ($9.33 billion-$10.66 billion) in non-oil state revenues by 2020 based on deals so far.A spokesman for Saudi National Center for Privatization & PPP said five public-private partnership infrastructure deals were closed since last December that involve more than 13 billion riyals in new investment in the next two to three years.“The opportunities to date are largely in listed equities and direct investment, and the privatisation or IPOs have been limited to the oil and gas sector,” said Richard Segal at Manulife Investment Management.Prince Mohammed has courted Silicon Valley with visits to companies including Facebook and Microsoft in 2016 and 2018. He has not visited a Western capital since Khashoggi was killed.Apple and Amazon were in talks in 2017 to set up a presence in Saudi Arabia, sources said at the time, but no deals have emerged.Asked if they would attend next week’s conference, Facebook and Apple declined to comment. Google and Amazon did not respond to a request to comment.The CEO of German conglomerate Siemens will not attend due to other commitments, a company spokesman said. South Korea’s Samsung will be represented by its CEO and will sign a memorandum of understanding with Saudi entertainment resort Qiddiya at the event, Qiddiya said.The White House, which has resisted pressure to punish Riyadh over human rights abuses citing its strategic importance, is sending its U.S. energy and treasury secretaries Rick Perry and Steven Mnuchin and senior adviser Jared Kushner.While last year’s event was dominated by leaders from Asian and Arab countries, next week’s gathering will include Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi.David Malpass, the head of the World Bank - which did not attend last year - will also be there.“FII may be an immediate reality check, but the real test of investor confidence in Saudi Arabia will involve a longer-term assessment of foreign direct investment trends, commercial regulations, and transparency measures,” Mogielnicki said.($1 = 3.7507 riyals)(Additional reporting by Alexander Cornwell and Hadeel Al Sayegh in Dubai, Stanley Carvalho in Abu Dhabi, David Lawder in Washignton, Pamela Barbaglia in London, Sam Nussey in Tokyo; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous/Carmel Crimmins/Jane Merriman)",pos
"(Adds Putin quotes)BRASILIA, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that Saudi Arabia was taking a tough stance on the output deal between OPEC and its allies because of Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering, but that Moscow respected Riyadh’s interests.Speaking to reporters in Brazil at a summit for BRICS countries, Putin said Moscow should continue to work with OPEC and that cooperation should not only be on oil production cuts.OPEC, Russia and other oil producers have since Jan. 1 implemented a deal to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day. In July, the alliance renewed their pact until March 2020.

"Saudi Aramco’s expected listing is widely predicted to be the world’s largest, and the global competition for the prestigious event is breaking out from boardrooms and into the public.Speaking to CNBC Wednesday, Hidetoshi Nagata, who heads new listings for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, made his case for Saudi Aramco, and said he believed the energy behemoth could opt for a listing in Japan.“We have met with Aramco’s people last year. We believe that they are quite interested in TSE,” he said, adding that representatives first met with the Saudi Ministry of Energy last October.Saudi Arabia is aiming to sell as much as 5 percent of Saudi Aramco with listings on both the Saudi stock exchange and at least one international market, Reuters reported recently, adding that the sale was expected to raise as much as $100 billion.That’s set off a horse race among global stock exchanges, with commentators naming a variety of cities — including Hong Kong, Singapore, New York, Toronto, London and Tokyo — as potential locations for the listing.Arun Kant, chief executive and chief investment officer at Singapore-based investing firm Leonie Hill Capital, told CNBC that his proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) system was predicting a 55 percent chance that the company would choose to list on the New York Stock Exchange. That was followed, he said, by a 30 percent chance for London, a 10 percent chance for Toronto, and 5 percent for Hong Kong.“Our model shows that because of market liquidity needs and keeping (President Donald) Trump happy, they are going to list the biggest IPO in the U.S.,” Kant said in an email to CNBC.Tokyo, Kant added, would likely be deemed too risky for the Saudis because of uncertainties about the yen.Still, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman is scheduled to visit Japan beginning March 12, and Aramco representatives are expected to be part of his delegation.“We would like to show the benefit [to Aramco] of listing on a global exchange. We have access to many individual investors and a successful track record of large fund-raising like Japan Post,”  Nagata said.“We have a deep investor base,” Nagata continued. “Aramco can raise huge funds, we’re the third largest by market cap, we’re also a global exchange, we have many top tier companies listed on our First Section. Institutional investors occupy half the trading base.”The Tokyo Stock Exchange official added that there are many high-net worth individual investors in Japan who could be attracted to an Aramco IPO on a local exchange.“We are confident we have high liquidity compared to other Asian stock exchanges like Singapore and Hong Kong,” he added.Singapore’s exchange, he said, is popular for derivatives, but less so for cash equity listings. And as for Hong Kong, Nagata said that exchange may boast China-based institutional investors, but it has fewer individual investors than Tokyo.Speaking with CNBC this week, HKEX CEO Charles Li made his own pitch for Aramco, saying an IPO in Hong Kong would be a “match made in heaven” because of a distinct value proposition.“We do bring very unique, very competitive proposition and value to that, both in terms of Hong Kong being an English common law jurisdiction, widely accepted by anybody as a listing venue with the most friendly and robust regulatory system,” Li said.“We are also very much an international market and operate completely under international law.”More from Global Investing Hot Spots:A $100 billion global arms race Trump wants to win This is the biggest loser if Trump ignites a trade war with China Saudi Aramco taps JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley for IPO; HSBC a contender No matter what artificial intelligence may be predicting, analysts and experts on the space emphasized that Saudi Aramco had a real decision before it.“I think competition between the key exchanges is very real, but Saudi Arabia will be very selective,” Ayham Kamel, director for Middle East and North Africa at the Eurasia Group, said in an email.“New York and London are the prime targets but the current Saudi leadership is keen on attracting Asian investors.”Both the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange declined to comment on Saudi Aramco’s planned listing when contacted for this story by CNBC. Toronto had confirmed earlier that it is in the hunt.Kamel called Tokyo’s hopes of nabbing the listing “a long shot,” but said it was not off the table. Hong Kong, he said, has “complications” because of a minimum free float requirement — for which the Saudis would seek an exemption. Singapore, meanwhile, is “viable” but has weak political linkages, he said.Several others offered similar analysis on the Asian exchanges, including Saxo Bank Chief Economist and CIO Steen Jakobsen, who said Tokyo’s chances are “close to zero” and Singapore’s likelihood was “small.” Jakobsen deemed Hong Kong’s IPO pitch “convincing.”Most interviewed by CNBC, however, said they saw at least one Saudi Aramco listing in the West.“As a multi-bourse listing, Asia has an opportunity to be competitive, but Saudi Arabia is still at the early stages of exploring the viability of an Asia listing,” Kamel said.Multiple international exchanges winning a piece of the listing is certainly a possibility, with several analysts saying such an outcome is the likely course of events.But the tea leaves about Saudi Aramco’s current leanings are apparently a challenge to read, with several well-placed experts telling CNBC that New York is either a complete shoo-in for the listing — or it stands absolutely no chance because of regulation and geopolitical concerns.—CNBC’s Gemma Acton, Leslie Shaffer and Fred Imbert contributed to this report.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",pos
"The Saudi Stock Exchange is gearing up for the initial public offering of state-owned oil company Aramco. “We are doing everything to get ready for Aramco’s listing,” Sarah Al-Suhaimi, chairwoman of the Saudi Stock Exchange, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Power Lunch.”The exchange, also called Tadawul, has made several changes in the last two years, including spinning off its depository center last year and moving the settlement cycle for trades from the same day to two days, Al-Suhaimi said. “Those were a few of the main requirements for international investors in our efforts to open up the Saudi market for investment, which started in 2015 and have been accelerated especially in the last 12 months,” she said.Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, intended to go public in a major financial city such as New York or London. It was expected to be the largest ever share listing with a valuation of $1 trillion to $2 trillion. But CNBC reported earlier this month that Aramco has delayed plans for any international listing and is now expected to hold its public offering domestically, possibly as soon as the second half of this year, according to sources familiar with the situation. Nasdaq has been particularly close with the Saudi exchange. “We’ve been a technology partner for the Saudi exchange for 20 years,” Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman also said Tuesday on “Power Lunch.” For the “last two years we’ve really focused on what are the core elements of infrastructure to develop to really welcome in foreign investment.”As for the Aramco IPO’s international ambitions, “we certainly are making sure that we’re well-positioned to be the choice for the kingdom if they make the decision to list outside Saudi Arabia,” Friedman said.— CNBC’s Patti Domm and Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.",pos
"Indecision over where to list shares of the world’s largest energy company are reportedly playing a major role in holding up what is expected to be the biggest-ever initial public offering.Saudi Aramco, currently a private company owned by the Saudi government, is aiming for an IPO that could raise about $100 billion and attract a valuation in the range of $1 trillion to $2 trillion this year. But the process has dragged on as key aspects of the share sale remain unsettled.The IPO is the centerpiece of Saudi Arabia’s plan to diversify its oil-dependent economy. It also stands to create a huge windfall for the army of bankers and lawyers involved in the offering.However, Saudi officials and outside advisors have warned Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, which the powerful royal prefers, would open Aramco to legal threats from shareholders and 9/11 victims, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.Family members of those killed in the World Trade Center attack have long sought to press a legal case against Saudi officials, alleging they shielded some of the attackers.The officials warning on an NYSE listing include Saudi Energy Minister and Aramco Chairman Khalid al-Falih, people familiar with the matter tell the Journal. Falih and other senior officials prefer a listing in London, where they see less legal risk, according to the paper.Saudi Aramco declined to comment on the Journal report.Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC last week that the company is ready to list in 2018, but it is waiting for its sole shareholder — the Saudi government — to make a decision about the listing venue.“It’s about evaluating all the information that is being passed to the government in terms of different markets that we have in terms of listed venues, whether it is in the U.K., or New York or Hong Kong or other markets,” Nasser said.The chances that Aramco will list this year are growing more remote, some of the Journal’s sources say, though some told the paper a 2018 IPO is still possible if Salman makes up his mind soon.The NYSE is at the top of Salman’s list because it comes with access to a huge pool of investors, carries international prestige and could bolster relations with the Trump administration, according to the Journal.President Donald Trump told the Saudis he would appreciate them choosing the NYSE in a November tweet.Other options include listing Aramco solely on Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul stock exchange, along with an investment from one of several countries’ sovereign wealth funds. However, the Journal notes that this would be difficult given the Tadawul’s total market capitalization is just $451 billion, as little as one-half to one-quarter the size of Aramco’s estimated valuation.In a November interview with CNBC, Nasser batted down rumors that Aramco is seeking an investment from China or another nation in lieu of listing on a foreign exchange.One “last resort” option under consideration involves creating a subsidiary that would hold some of Aramco’s upstream and downstream assets, businesses that include exploring for and producing fossil fuels and refining them into fuel and petrochemicals, respectively. That subsidiary would then be listed, protecting the larger company from lawsuits, one person told the Journal.Investment banks tell the Journal the delays risk sparking an exodus of experts from the project. Bankers, lawyers and consultants are growing concerned about their career opportunities and bonuses while shepherding the Aramco IPO to completion.Saudi Aramco recently invited additional banks including Goldman Sachs to the kingdom to pitch for a role in the IPO, Reuters reported earlier this month.Read the full story here.",pos
"Saudi Aramco’s plan to take a portion of its business public next year remains on track, the oil giant’s chief executive Amin Nasser told CNBC in an exclusive interview.Nasser made his comments Sunday following recent reports that the initial public offering for the world’s largest energy company could be delayed into 2019 or shelved in favor of selling private shares to sovereign wealth funds. Saudi Aramco has tried to swat down those rumors, and Nasser denied the reports again in an interview with “Squawk Box” in the command center at Saudi Aramco headquarters in Dhahran.“We have always said that we will be listing in 2018, and to be more specific, in the second half of 2018,” he said. “However, I think journalists and writers — they are expecting more and more information, and we are governed by, you know, certain rules with regard to talking about the IPO and all of that.”“The IPO is on track. The listing venue will be discussed and shared in due course,” Nasser added.Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, plans to list its shares on the Saudi domestic stock market, the Tadawul, and one or more foreign exchanges. However, it has yet to choose the overseas market, fueling speculation about the kingdom’s plans. The Financial Times reported last month that China was emerging as a front-runner in the possible plan to delay the IPO and sell shares to sovereign wealth funds.Asked directly about the report, Nasser denied it. “Saudi Aramco are not talking, as I said, to the Chinese or others,” he said.“All of that analysis is being reviewed in detail ... to make a decision at a certain stage, and we’re not going to be pushed, you know, by a journalist saying this needs to be talked about or not.”The IPO for roughly 5 percent of the company is widely expected to be the largest in history. Saudi officials have said Aramco could attract a $2 trillion valuation, though others forecast the offering will value the company at $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion. In any case, investment banks tapped to handle the transaction stand to reap a huge windfall.The share sale is also critical to Saudi Arabia’s economic future. The kingdom aims to raise about $100 billion to underwrite Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to diversify the nation’s economy through a plan called “Vision 2030.”Nasser believes Saudi Aramco is at the heart of that plan and the kingdom’s transformation. He said the IPO will facilitate key initiatives to grow private business’ share of the economy, create more small- and medium-sized enterprises, boost industrialization and employment and encourage women to join the workforce.Some fund managers recently told CNBC their concerns about the IPO include minority shareholder rights, the transparency of oil reserves, the viability of fossil fuels and how the Saudis will balance national priorities and their duty to shareholders.Saudi oil revenues have historically funded its social spending, a critical aspect of its pact to provide for its citizens and its large royal family. That pact is seen as the key to maintaining relative stability in a region rocked by social upheaval in recent years.Nasser predicted it will be easy to convey to investors how Saudi Aramco’s focus on long-term planning has allowed the company to drive past results. He believes the interests of its sole current shareholder — the government — and its future investors are aligned.“I think both are looking for results,” he said. “Both are going to be looking for a better performance, and I don’t see any issues between our current shareholder and the public that will be participating when we are listed because ultimately we need to deliver better results.”Nasser also addressed the issue of transparency. Some investors have questioned Saudi oil reserves, which have remained roughly constant at about 260 billion to 265 billion barrels since 1989.Saudi Aramco has kept up a robust exploration program, even through the three-year oil price downturn, allowing it to add to its reserves, according to Nasser. He promised that Saudi Aramco will “meet all the requirements of that market in terms of reserve assessment” and other rules of the country where it chooses to list.Ultimately, Saudi Arabia is largely operating in line with its closest peers, the integrated international oil companies like Exxon Mobil and BP, Nasser said.“I can say Aramco has always been run like a publicly traded company,” he said. “If you look at our governance, we have independent board members. Everything that has been done in the company is similar to any international oil company in terms of the way we do business.”",pos
"Oil giant Saudi Aramco is readying what’s set to be the biggest initial public offering ever. But as it turns out, investors might not be all that interested.In fact, fund managers told CNBC that the Saudi energy behemoth — the valuation of which has seen estimates from $1 trillion to $2 trillion — comes up short for all three basic tests investors apply to potential IPO investments: growth, an attractive dividend and solid corporate governance.Saudi Arabia, which plans to float 5 percent of the state-owned oil giant, may earmark the lions’ share of the issue to strategic investors, reportedly from China, if the response from the broader market seems lukewarm.The initial signals don’t look positive.Even portfolio managers with a reasonably bullish view on the price of oil are thinking twice about buying into Aramco because of uncertainty about the true extent of the company’s — and effectively the Kingdom’s — oil reserves.“That’s going to be the biggest hurdle. What are we buying?” said Kunal Ghosh, portfolio manager of global emerging markets at Allianz Global Investors who manages $2.1 billion. “For the last 100 years there’s never been a published number that’s validated. My enthusiasm for the IPO is very low.”Though Ghosh said he believed a higher price environment for oil may support the valuation during the initial stages when Aramco does come to market, the perceived lack of transparency over reserves and what’s seen as weak corporate governance stemming from decades of state control represent longer-term structural hurdles for many investors.“When I’m buying an oil company, I’m doing it because I have a view on the commodity, a view on reserves and a view on the management and their respect for my view as a minority shareholder,” Ghosh told CNBC on Thursday.“Saudi Aramco has been a private company for decades, and needs a change of mindset,” Ghosh added. “Until there’s a change of mindset, it will keep us on the sidelines. What multiples it will get for its reserves and earnings will be determined by their corporate governance.”To be sure, Aramco is in the process of attempting to answer the markets’ questions.The company has appointed international auditors to independently assess its massive oil reserves, a process that’s expected to be completed by the end of the year. The result of that audit — and whether it undershoots or overshoots the official Saudi figure of over 261 billion barrels — will have a direct impact on the all-important valuation.“In Saudi, they have done some verification in some small areas, but the full verification will take several years and will take time,” said Fereidun Fesharaki, founder of energy consultancy, FACTS Global Energy. “However, based on the crude production capability, I think they may have more reserves than they said.”How Aramco handles the transition from national oil company to one answerable to shareholders, though in a minority, will be closely watched by the market.Offering only 5 percent of the company “means investors are a very small minority and minority rights might be subordinated to national interests,” said Bryan Goh, chief investment officer at private bank Bordier & Cie in Singapore. “Aramco is not just an oil and gas company, it’s the sovereign wealth fund and economic and social development fund of Saudi Arabia. We can’t be confident that the company will be managed from a purely commercial perspective.”Beyond questions of corporate priorities, many fund managers are also concerned that Aramco’s business model simply won’t stand up over the longer term as the rise of renewable energy undermines the future growth prospects for traditional oil and gas producers.“It’s a bit like asking if you would buy Ford if it was to IPO tomorrow. Unlikely. Its day in the sun has passed,” said Warren Gilman, chairman and CEO of CEF Holdings.Thomas Hugger, founder and CEO of fund manager Asia Frontier Capital, added: “We are not really bullish on the oil price due to the strong push by China to reduce the air pollution. However, each investment has its price and if the valuation is very attractive (which I doubt) it could be worth an investment.”One route that may enable Saudi Aramco to pull in buyers for its shares could be inclusion into the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, but would investors buy Aramco on a stand-alone basis?“Maybe not,” said Michael Preiss, a Singapore-based portfolio strategist at Taurus Family Office with $1.9 billion of assets under advisory. “It may be part of the (MSCI EM) Index, so you’ll be forced to buy it.”And in a world that’s shifting away from fossil fuels, Aramco is “a bit backward looking,” Preiss said. “It’s more of a sunset industry. The Saudis are realizing it’s the end of the cycle.”Still, Aramco has its supporters.“We need to see how they manage the governance but there’s no doubt that everybody around the world is going to be interested in looking at Aramco,” said Robert Thummel, managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, which handles $16 billion in energy-related assets.He pointed to its “massive reserves and the low-cost nature of production.”",pos

"* Russia, OPEC allies meet in early December in ViennaCurrent oil output cuts expires after March 2020* Russia starts pipeline natural gas exports to China in December (Adds details on Russia having difficulties in cutting oil output in winter)By Olesya Astakhova and Vladimir SoldatkinMOSCOW, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Russia is unlikely to agree to deepen cuts in oil output at a meeting with fellow exporters next month, but could commit to extend existing curbs to support Saudi Arabia, three sources said on Tuesday.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Dec. 5 at its headquarters in Vienna, followed by talks with a group of other exporters, which includes Russia, known as OPEC+.Also on Dec. 5, Saudi Arabia is set to announce the pricing for the public share placement of its energy giant, Saudi Aramco <IPO-ARMO.SE>, in what it hopes will be the world’s largest IPO. The oil price at the time is likely to be critical to the pricing of the share offering.The sources told Reuters that OPEC and its allies are worried about weak demand growth in 2020.Russian President Vladimir Putin set the tone for the December meeting last week, calling Saudi Arabia’s position ahead of the talks “tough”.Moscow argues that it will be hard for it to cut oil production voluntarily during the cold winter months, especially in western Siberia, where Russia produces two-thirds of its oil and where most of its well rigs are located.Experts have said that an oil well could explode if halted in frozen conditions. However, there are risks that extreme low temperatures of around minus 50 Celsius (minus 58 Fahrenheit), could lead to an involuntary production decline.When the cuts agreement started on Jan. 1 2017, Russia implemented its commitments gradually, only reaching full compliance in May that year.“We expect uneasy talks in December. Russia will not categorically agree to (deepen) cuts in winter,” a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The oil ministry did not respond to a request for comment.“SURPRISES” POSSIBLEIn the latest iteration of the deal, OPEC, Russia and some other large oil producers, have agreed to cut their combined oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan.1. The agreement runs through to the end of March.“Serious consultations have not yet started. Rollover looks more likely. Russia cannot reduce more in winter time. But surprises are always a possibility,” an OPEC source said.On Monday, a source familiar with the data told Reuters that in November Russia had increased its oil production <C-RU-OUT> to 11.25 million barrels per day (bpd), missing its output targets.Under the pact with OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Russia should cap output at around 11.17-11.18 million bpd, according to Reuters calculations, which use a tonne/barrel ratio of 7.33.Russian natural gas supplies to China, which are set to start next month, will also boost output of gas condensate, part of the oil mix.Another industry source said that Russian companies are seeking to boost their output in 2020 to support the state budget.Alexei Kudrin, a close ally of Putin and head of the Audit Chamber, has said that Russia’s budgeted spending will be 1 trillion roubles ($16 billion) lower this year compared to the previous year.($1 = 63.8513 roubles) (Reporting by Olesya Astakhova and Vladimir Soldatkin in Moscow, Ahmad Ghaddar in London and Rania El-Gamal in Dubai.

"Saudi Arabia’s state-controlled energy giant Aramco has reached a $69.1 billion deal to purchase a majority stake in petrochemicals firm Sabic from the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund.The deal will see Aramco purchase the 70 percent stake in Sabic held by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund in a share purchase agreement. It will expand Aramco’s footprint in refining and petrochemicals and inject cash into PIF, which underpins ambitious plans to remake Saudi Arabia’s economy.Aramco and PIF announced the news Wednesday shortly after CNBC and other news outlets confirmed the transaction. The deal remains subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals.“This is a win-win-win transaction and a transformational deal for three of Saudi Arabia’s most important economic entities,” PIF Managing Director Yasir Othman Al-Rumayyan said in a statement. “It will unlock significant capital for PIF’s continued long-term investment strategy, underpinning sectoral and revenue diversification for Saudi Arabia.” Saudi Arabia is attempting to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on oil revenues under a plan called Vision 2030 directed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Plans to sell shares in Aramco are meant to underwrite that endeavor, but an initial public offering on an international exchange has been delayed by several years.The Aramco-Sabic deal further delayed the IPO plans — the company now expects to list shares in 2021. The kingdom sought to raise $100 billion by publicly listing a small percentage of Aramco.Wednesday’s agreement comes as Aramco, the world’s largest oil company by production, is expanding its high-value downstream operations, which includes refining crude oil into fuels and making petrochemicals.Aramco currently has the capacity to produce 17 million tons of petrochemicals per year, while Sabic’s capacity is 62 million tons. By 2030, Aramco aims to increase its refining capacity from 4.9 million barrels per day to 8 million to 10 million bpd.“This transaction is a major step in accelerating Saudi Aramco’s transformative downstream growth strategy of integrated refining and petrochemicals,” Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement. “SABIC is a world-class company with an outstanding workforce and chemicals capabilities.”Sabic has operations in 50 countries and employees about 35,000 people around the world.Investors own the remaining 30 percent stake in Sabic through shares listed on the Saudi stock exchange.

"With a new Federal Reserve chairman and higher U.S. interest rates on the horizon, some emerging markets are more vulnerable than others to tightening monetary conditions in 2018. One country seen in the cross hairs is Saudi Arabia, already in the throes of broad economic reform.Although last year was favorable for developing countries, investors remember the painful “taper tantrum” that ensued several years ago, when the Fed signaled it would begin pulling back on its massive bond purchases that kept rates low while injecting liquidity in markets.Some markets are likely to fare better than others, but observers say countries with currencies linked to the dollar, like Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, have a lot riding on the outcome.So-called “dollar-sphere” markets have monetary policy that is at least partly outsourced to the Fed, and by extension are vulnerable to rate hikes. “These are the countries that must heed the Fed,” L. Bryan Carter, head of emerging markets Fixed Income with BNP Paribas Asset Management, said.Citing upside risks to inflation that may boost the U.S. dollar, Bank of America this week said 3 Fed hikes this year was a real possibility.“Most central banks across emerging markets have completed rate cutting cycles,” said Jim Barrineau, co-head of emerging markets debt at Schroders Investment Management.“If Fed rate hikes do not result in a stronger dollar — as has been the case so far — then these countries should be relatively unaffected,” said Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at investment firm Columbia Threadneedle.“If U.S. rates move too quickly, they will dislocate [high yielding] assets more broadly and the most liquid emerging markets will not be immune to a selloff,” he added, pointing to the 2013 taper tantrum as an illustration of this idea in action.The key question for emerging market investors is whether the dollar will head higher if the Fed decides to hike rates. If the dollar remains stable or in its softening trend, then local rates are still broadly attractive. And dollar pegged-currencies, mainly Saudi Arabia’s riyal, which is pegged at 3.75 to the greenback, could take a significant hit. For decades, Gulf nations have maintained their currencies at certain levels to the dollar, so tighter U.S. policy could undermine their efforts to manage their economies.The issue is particularly sensitive for Saudi Arabia, which is transforming its economy ahead of an expected initial public offering by state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco. While most market observers don’t believe the kingdom will abandon its monetary arrangements, U.S. policy could inject more uncertainty into an already volatile situation.“In order to maintain the peg, the Saudi authorities have to move interest rates in lockstep with the Fed,” Marcus Chenevix, a London-based MENA analyst with TS Lombard, told CNBC.“If they do not raise interest rates as the Fed raises rates, then the riyal becomes unattractive to hold because the dollar would give a higher rate of return than the riyal, while still being exchangeable for the same amount or riyals, it would be a huge incentive” for investors to bet against the riyal/dollar peg.As the Fed raises rates, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) is likely to follow suit. According to investors, therein lies the dilemma for Saudi policymakers: The country is only just pulling out of recession, and the last thing that the economy needs is a sustained dose of tightening, Chenevix explained.Deputy Crown Prince “Mohammed bin Salman’s (MBS) plans to rejuvenate the Saudi economy while keeping public finances stable will be a lot harder with such an inappropriate monetary policy,” he said.Dollar-pegged countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) don’t have currency depreciation to help offset to higher domestic interest rates. Without the release valve of cheaper money — and the economic boost provided by exports — credit conditions may tighten.“The risk is that this translates into lower growth and has to be offset by fiscal stimulus funded by additional government borrowing at higher interest rates,” Chevenix added.With oil prices stabilizing in double-digits, Saudi Arabia is looking ahead to what could be a significant move on the global stage — the massive and strategically important Saudi Aramco IPO, which is being watched by investors around the world.Should MBS want to have an economic recovery and at the same time hike rates, “then he is going to have to spend more from the public purse,” Chevenix said.“The worse the fiscal situation, the more careful investors need to be about examining how the government is planning to extract money from Aramco when it is finally listed,” the analyst said. “One does not want to own part of a company when the majority shareholder is running out of money.”",pos

"* Russia, OPEC allies meet in early December in Vienna* Current oil output cuts expires after March 2020* Russia starts pipeline natural gas exports to China in DecemberMOSCOW, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Russia is unlikely to agree to deepen cuts in oil output at a meeting with fellow exporters next month, but could commit to extend existing curbs to support Saudi Arabia, three sources said on Tuesday.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Dec. 5 at its headquarters in Vienna, followed by talks with a group of other exporters, which includes Russia, known as OPEC+.On the same day, Dec 5, Saudi Arabia is set to announce the pricing for the public share placement of its energy giant, Saudi Aramco <IPO-ARMO.SE>, in what it hopes will be the world's largest IPO. The oil price at the time is likely to be critical to the pricing of the share offering.The sources told Reuters that OPEC and its allies are worried about weak demand growth in 2020.Russian President Vladimir Putin set the tone for the December meeting last week, calling Saudi Arabia's position ahead of the talks ""tough"".Moscow argues that it will be hard for it to cut oil production voluntarily during the cold winter months. When the cuts agreement started on Jan. 1 2017, Russia implemented its commitments gradually, only reaching full compliance in May that year.""We expect uneasy talks in December. Russia will not categorically agree to (deepen) cuts in winter,"" a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The oil ministry did respond to a request for comment.In the latest iteration of the deal, OPEC, Russia and some other large oil producers, have agreed to cut their combined oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day from Jan.1. The agreement runs through to the end of March.""Serious consultations have not yet started. Rollover looks more likely. Russia cannot reduce more in winter time. But surprises are always a possibility,"" an OPEC source said.On Monday, a source familiar with the data told Reuters that in November Russia had increased its oil production <C-RU-OUT> to 11.25 million barrels per day (bpd), missing its output targets.Under the pact with OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Russia should cap output at around 11.17-11.18 million bpd, according to Reuters calculations, which use a tonne/barrel ratio of 7.33.Russian natural gas supplies to China, which are set to start next month, will also boost output of gas condensate, part of the oil mix.Another industry source said that Russian companies are seeking to boost their output in 2020 to support the state budget.Alexei Kudrin, a close ally of Putin and head of the Audit Chamber, has said that Russia's budgeted spending will be 1 trillion roubles ($16 billion) lower this year compared to the previous year.($1 = 63.8513 roubles) (Reporting by Olesya Astakhova and Vladimir Soldatkin in Moscow, Ahmad Ghaddar in London and Rania El-Gamal in Dubai.

"Saudi Arabia could be tempted to reconsider the timing of what is expected to be the biggest-ever initial public offering (IPO) later this year, BP CEO Bob Dudley told CNBC on Tuesday.Indecision at the highest levels of Saudi Arabia’s government is reportedly playing a major role in holding up the planned flotation of the world’s largest oil producer.Saudi Aramco, currently a private company owned by the government in Riyadh, is aiming for an IPO that could raise about $100 billion and attract a valuation in the range of $1 trillion to $2 trillion later this year. But the process has dragged on as key aspects of the share sale remain unsettled.When Dudley was asked whether he believed Saudi Aramco’s IPO was on track to take place in the second half of 2018, he replied: “I don’t know, I mean they say it will. I know there’s lots of preparation work going on. I think little dislocations in the market will make them think again.”“The big questions are if they do, when? And where would they list? I think that debate seems to me to be alive and well,” he said.The IPO is the centerpiece of Saudi Arabia’s plan to diversify its oil-dependent economy. It also stands to create a huge windfall for the army of bankers and lawyers involved in the offering.Meanwhile, Saudi officials have claimed preparatory work regarding the IPO has been completed. However, some key issues — such as where to list — rest with the government.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is believed to favor listing Saudi Aramco in New York, while officials, including Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, have reportedly said London could be a better fit. Hong Kong is also in contention.Another option is a Saudi listing alongside an international exchange. A domestic listing and a private sale to a strategic investor — possibly from Beijing — is a third possibility.“There’s a huge amount of uncertainty and I think that uncertainty is actually coming from the Saudis themselves to be perfectly honest,” Nick Coleman, senior oil analyst at S&P Global Platts, told CNBC on Tuesday.— CNBC’s Tom DiChristoper contributed to this report.",pos

"Saudi Aramco just got a high-profile pitch for its upcoming initial public offering. It came from the president of the United States himself.The world’s largest oil company will debut its shares on the Saudi domestic market, called the Tadawul, but it is also expected to list on at least one foreign exchange in the second half of next year. Its decision, which it has yet to announce, is being closely watched.On Saturday, President Donald Trump specifically requested the company opt for the New York Stock Exchange, tweeting that the IPO would be “important” to the U.S. Trump is currently in Hawaii ahead of a 13-day tour through Asia.The Big Board is the world’s largest equity market trading companies with a combined market capitalization of $21.3 trillion as of June and is seen as an enduring symbol of American capitalism.Where Saudi Aramco lists also carries weighty regulatory implications for the company, as listing on a U.S. or European exchange comes with financial disclosure requirements, as well as Western-style corporate governance and transparency expectations.The Trump administration has been engaged in an aggressive courtship of Saudi Arabia, in part as a check against the ambitions of Iran. In May, as part of Trump’s maiden trip abroad, the U.S. inked a $350 billion arms deal with the nation, in a move that solidified an alliance marred by controversy over the years.Saudi Aramco’s offering is likely to be one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in history. Depending on who’s being asked, the company’s valuation is pegged at somewhere north of $1 trillion. Recently, the company has appointed JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and HSBC to assist with its mammoth IPO next year.  Last month, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC the plan to take a portion of the state-owned oil giant’s business public next year remained on track, but was cagey about its choice of an international listing venue.In that interview, Nasser said that the Saudis “enjoyed” Trump’s trip to the kingdom, calling it “a very successful visit... [that] gained a lot of support here in terms of strengthening relations and collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S.”Spokespeople for both Saudi Aramco and the NYSE declined to comment on Saturday.—CNBC’s Sam Meredith and Holly Gamble contributed to this article.",pos
"Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil behemoth is increasingly looking to just float locally, as plans to list on an international exchange hang in the balance, Reuters reported, citing sources close to the matter.Saudi Aramco had planned to begin trading on the country’s domestic stock market — the Tadawul — and one or more foreign exchanges in the second half of 2018. London, New York and Hong Kong are among the foreign bourses currently competing for the share sale.However, a Reuters report on Tuesday morning suggested Riyadh is now banking on being awarded emerging market status in the influential MSCI benchmark equity index in June, according to its sources. Significantly more money tracks emerging markets which should allow Aramco to attract Western funds, in addition to other flagship investors from China, Japan and South Korea. “I would guess it is about evens that there will be no international IPO,” said a high-level source familiar with the preparations, according to Reuters. The source added that the preparations were proving to be a disappointment. CNBC has not been able to independently verify these sources. Saudi Aramco was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.Meanwhile, on Sunday, another report said that Aramco’s listing would be pushed back to 2019. The prospect of a delayed IPO would represent a significant setback for a central plank of Riyadh’s plans to modernize its economy.The Financial Times, citing British officials who had been briefed during a state visit, reported that Aramco’s IPO — widely seen as the cornerstone project of the kingdom’s bid to reform — is struggling to arrive at the $2 trillion valuation sought by Saudi’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Saudi Aramco, currently a private company owned by the kingdom’s government, is aiming for an IPO that could raise about $100 billion and attract a valuation in the range of $1 trillion to $2 trillion.Indecision at the highest level of Saudi Arabia’s government over where to list internationally — if at all — is thought to have stoked frustration among company executives. Saudi’s Bin Salman is believed to favor a listing in New York, while officials, including Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, reportedly favor London. Nonetheless, both the U.S. and the U.K. require greater disclosure of sensitive information on Aramco and this is viewed by Saudi officials as a pitfall, according to Reuters sources.  Therefore, with the prospect of a transatlantic listing fading, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Hong Kong is quickly becoming a genuine contender. This would likely help Riyadh with its efforts to draw sizable investments from several Asian nations.Aramco said Monday that it was still reviewing its options for an IPO.A major bourse is estimated to need at least six months to prepare for a listing, Reuters sources said, so a decision would need to be taken in April if Aramco is to go ahead with the IPO in 2018.",pos
"The long-awaited initial public offering of Saudi Arabia’s massive oil company could be delayed until 2019 at the earliest, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing British officials briefed on the matter.Saudi Aramco IPO was expected to come to market sometime this year, potentially the largest ever. However, the FT stated that advisors are struggling to arrive at the $2 trillion valuation sought by Saudi’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.Last week, Bloomberg reported that Saudi Arabian energy minister also suggested the flotation might be delayed. If so, it would represent a setback for the world’s largest oil producer’s efforts to reform its economy, as the Aramco IPO is seen as a linchpin in its strategy.According to the FT, people briefed on the negotiations say London was a prime contender to land the actual listing. The battle between where Aramco’s stock would list is seen as a horse race between the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.The full Financial Times story can be found on its website.",pos
"A few days after President Donald Trump made a high-profile pitch for Saudi Aramco to list on the New York Stock Exchange, prominent investor Mark Mobius said the city is “pretty much out” of the running.A number of exchanges including those in New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore are gunning for the initial public offering of Saudi Arabia’s state oil company — estimated to be one of the most valuable companies in the world. Aramco has said it will float its shares on the local Saudi exchange, Tadawul, and another one or two overseas markets in the second half of 2018.“I think New York is pretty much out because of the risk that they have litigation. London may be out too because they don’t want to disclose a lot of the inner workings of Aramco, so it’s going to be very interesting to see what happens with that deal,” Mobius, the executive chairman of Templeton Emerging Markets Group, said Friday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”A Financial Times report in June said lawyers warned Saudi Arabia that a New York listing posed “the greatest litigation risk of any jurisdiction.” Reuters followed up with a report in August that the Middle Eastern kingdom still favored New York despite the risks.Trump on Sunday tweeted that it was “Important to the United States!” that Aramco float its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.But Mobius said the decision, a closely-watched one amid the anti-corruption drive and political purge in Saudi Arabia, seems to still be up in the air.He added that a “full and fair disclosure” will be the key for Aramco to attract investors, including his firm Templeton.“Disclosure is really the key,” he said. “Of course, it could be quite exciting. It could be one of the most exciting companies listed ... but they have to disclose what’s going on, what are the inner workings and also what will be the decisions regarding earnings because a big part of their earnings go to the government.”Even as Mobius takes a cautious approach when it comes to Aramco, he was explicit in his optimism about Saudi Arabia. He said reforms in the kingdom “have been a long time coming” and it is a good sign that the authorities are accelerating those efforts.He was referring to the crackdown over the weekend that saw the arrest of dozens of Saudi princes, ministers, officials and businessmen.“Long term, (I’m) very optimistic,” he said. “I think it’s just the beginning. I think you’re going to see a lot more coming down the road and of course the key now is to set up the institutions to continue this fight.”",pos
"* Exposed to Argentina, which could provide opportunities* Interest in Saudi Aramco IPO depends on price* Adjusted EBITDA rises 10% to 201.8 mln pounds, shares up (Recasts with CFO comments on emerging markets, adds shares)LONDON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The impact of U.S.-China trade conflict on China and the global economy was a major concern for Ashmore, its chief financial officer said on Friday, as the emerging market fund manager posted a 10% rise in full-year core profit.China and the United States on Thursday agreed to hold high-level talks in early October in Washington, cheering investors hoping for a thaw in relations even as new U.S. tariffs on Chinese consumer goods chip away at global growth.Ashmore invests in emerging markets across a range of equity, debt, multi-asset and alternative funds for institutional and retail clients.“We are watching it closely, it is material to us, we think the impact is broader than just on China,” Tom Shippey told Reuters by telephone.The fund manager has exposure to China but Shippey said the world’s second-largest economy “is relatively well placed to cope - it has high savings ratios, good domestic GDP growth and an ability to withstand some of the U.S. action.”Ashmore also has exposure to Argentina across its funds, mainly in fixed income assets, but Shippey said the political situation could “create opportunities for active managers”.Argentina’s likely next president, opposition front-runner Alberto Fernandez, laid out his populist credentials during a visit to Madrid on Thursday, saying Argentine interests would trump those of creditors and energy investors.“Prices tend to overreact,” Shippey said, pointing to Argentine bonds yielding close to 50%. The fund manager could add to its positions if it thought default was unlikely, he added.Ashmore, which has a business in Saudi Arabia, was also watching Saudi Aramco’s plans for an initial public offering, he said, but Ashmore’s interest in the IPO would depend on price.Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producing company, is preparing an IPO of up to a 5% stake by 2020-2021.Ashmore recorded adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 201.8 million pounds ($248.9 million) for the year ending June 2019, helped by net inflows and strong markets.Assets under management were previously reported at $91.8 billion at the end of June, up 24% from a year earlier.It recorded net inflows of $10.7 billion over the one-year period and positive investment performance of $6.9 billion.Ashmore’s shares were up 1.6% at 460 pence per share at 0807 GMT.

The listing process and bookbuild would then proceed during the week of Nov. 25, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.An Alibaba spokesman declined to comment to Reuters on the timing of the listing.The transaction, Dealogic data showed, would be the world’s biggest-ever cross-border secondary listing. Alibaba currently holds the record for the world’s biggest initial public offering for its $25 billion 2014 float in New York.The e-commerce giant’s Hong Kong listing would also set up a year-end rush for global equity markets, with the Saudi government planning to sell 2 per cent of oil giant Aramco in a deal that could raise up to $30 billion and topple Alibaba’s own IPO record.HONG KONG, TIMINGAlibaba had initially been working on an August listing in Hong Kong but put the deal on hold as anti-government protests in the city created financial and political uncertainty.The new timing means the company will have an opportunity to show prospective investors its most recent sales figures after Monday’s Singles Day, mainland China’s largest annual online shopping day.Alibaba’s sales last year reached $30 billion on the day, which was more than three times as large as Cyber Monday, the equivalent shopping day in the U.S.Alibaba last week reported second-quarter revenue increased by 40%, to 119.02 billion yuan ($16.91 billion) in the second quarter from 85.15 billion yuan in the previous year earlier.The result beat analysts expectations of revenue of 116.8 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.The company will next week appoint more banks to help sell its shares in Hong Kong, sources said.The deal is currently being led by China International Capital Corp (CICC) and Credit Suisse. Major investment banks led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are currently jockeying for the most senior positions behind those two.Alibaba has also worked closely with Deutsche Bank in the past, according to Refinitiv statistics, but the bank slashed headcount in its equity capital market business worldwide this summer.If both the Alibaba and Aramco deals succeed, they could provide a shot in the arm for moribund capital markets, where investors have proved increasingly sceptical of the valuations sought by much-hyped tech start-ups such as ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies, which has fallen 34 % since its float in May.More recently, office-space sharing startup WeWork was forced to drop IPO plans and seek a cash injection from Japans SoftBank Group, a major shareholder, as its valuation collapsed to $8 billion from $47 billion as recently as January this year.Companies so far this year have sold shares worth $429 billion via IPOs and follow-on sales  running far short of the $604 billion they sold in the whole of 2018, according to data from Refinitiv.(Reporting by Scott Murdoch; Editing by Christopher Cushing & Simon Cameron-Moore)",pos
"November - sources@ (Adds context)Nov 8 (Reuters) - Chinese retail titan Alibaba plans to list in Hong Kong in the final week of November, two people with direct knowledge said, aiming to raise up to $15 billion in a deal that signals a vote of confidence in the Asian financial hub.The public offering by the e-commerce specialist, whose primary listing is in the United States, would take place at a pivotal moment for Hong Kong’s future as the city has been wracked by months of anti-government protests.It also comes at a time when there has been a thaw in relations between China and the United States, which have been locked in a trade war that has buffeted financial markets.Alibaba’s bookbuilding and listing is due to take place in the week beginning Nov. 25, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.The company is first due to seek approval from Hong Kong’s listing committee next week, on Thursday, two separate sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.An Alibaba spokesman declined to comment on the timing of the share offering.The transaction would be the world’s biggest-ever cross-border secondary listing, according to Dealogic data. Alibaba currently holds the crown for the world’s biggest initial public offering for its $25 billion 2014 float in New York.Alibaba has not said what it plans to do with the proceeds of the secondary listing, in which it aims to raise between $10 billion and $15 billion.However the company is looking to expand its Chinese customer base beyond its core market in big cities to less developed areas to combat slowing retail sales growth.It also faces rising competition from nimbler rivals such as Pinduoduo which have outsmarted the retail juggernaut in smaller cities with deep discounts and group-buying deals.ALIBABA & ARAMCOThe Hong Kong listing presages a year-end rush for global equity markets, with the Saudi government planning to sell 2% of oil giant Aramco in a deal that could raise up to $30 billion and topple Alibaba’s own IPO record.If both deals succeed, they could provide a shot in the arm for moribund capital markets, where investors have proved increasingly skeptical of the valuations sought by much-hyped tech start-ups such as ride-hailing giant Uber, which has fallen by about a third since its float in May.More recently, office-space sharing startup WeWork was forced to drop its IPO plans and seek a cash injection from investor SoftBank Group as its valuation collapsed to $8 billion from $47 billion.Companies have sold shares worth $429 billion via IPOs and follow-on sales so far this year  far short of the $604 billion in the whole of 2018, according to data from Refinitiv.HK BOURSE RESURGENTAlibaba had initially been working on an August listing in Hong Kong but put the deal on hold as anti-government protests left the city mired in financial and political uncertainty.The return of this deal would cap a resurgent market in Hong Kong, where a series of big floats since September have helped the bourse operator, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX), become serious competition once more to the American players.So far companies in Hong Kong have sold shares worth $22.3 billion via IPOs this year, compared with $24.5 billion on Nasdaq and $22.6 billion via the NYSE, according to Refinitiv data.Alibaba’s decision in 2013 to drop plans for a primary listing in Hong Kong, and turn instead to New York, triggered passionate debate among bankers and officials, and resulted in rule changes that paved the way for this deal.Now bankers and investors are watching closely to see whether other U.S.-listed Chinese companies such as Baidu and JD.com might follow Alibaba’s lead.The listing could yet be delayed, however, if the protests worsen once more. The demonstrations are in their fifth month and are frequently violent.

"minister@ (Adds quotes, IPO comment)JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will restore its lost oil production by the end of September and has managed to recover supplies to customers to the levels they were at prior to weekend attacks on its facilities by drawing from its huge oil inventories.Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said on Tuesday that average oil production in September and October would be 9.89 million barrels per day and that the world’s top oil exporter would ensure full oil supply commitments to its customers this month.“Over the past two days we have contained the damage and restored more than half of the production that was down as a result of the terrorist attack,” Prince Abdulaziz told a news conference in the Red Sea city of Jeddah.He said the kingdom would achieve 11 million bpd capacity by end of September and 12 million bpd by end of November.“Oil supplies will be returned to the market as they were before 3:43 a.m. Saturday,” he said, adding that state oil giant Aramco had emerged “like a phoenix from the ashes” after the attack.He was referring to attacks on Saturday on state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco’s plants in Abqaiq and Khurais, including the world’s largest oil processing facility, which shut down 5.7 million barrels per day, which is more than half of Saudi Arabia’s production, or 5% of global output.Aramco’s Chief Executive Amin Nasser said the company, which is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO), was still in the process of estimating repair work but that it was “not that significant,” given the company’s size.“We should be at our production (level) before the attacks on our facility by the end of September,” Nasser told the same news conference.Aramco had put out 10 fires in the span of seven hours after the “huge” assault, Nasser said.He said the company was in the process of bringing back oil refining to full capacity and that there were enough crude products to supply the local markets. Aramco’s crude oil inventories are more than 60 million barrels, he said.Speaking at the same news conference, Aramco’s Chairman Yasser al-Rumayyan, said Aramco’s IPO would be ready within the coming 12 months and that the kingdom was committed to the listing.Rumayyan said the IPO would “continue as it is” despite weekend attacks and that timing would depend on market conditions.Prince Abdulaziz said Riyadh did not yet know who carried out the strikes or why, adding Saudi Arabia would keep its role as a secure supplier of global markets. He said stricter measures needed to be taken to prevent further attacks, but did not elaborate.The foreign ministry has said that preliminary investigations indicated Iranian weapons were used in the assault, which authorities initially said involved drones.

" Launching the Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO) on Hong Kong stock exchange would be a “match made in heaven,” Charles Li, CEO of HKEx, told CNBC. The expected listing of the Saudi oil and gas company is predicted to be the world’s largest initial public offering ever. Saudi Arabia is aiming to sell as much as 5 percent of Saudi Aramco with listings on both the Saudi stock exchange and at least one international market, Reuters reported recently, adding that the sale was expected to raise as much as $100 billion.That’s set off a horse race among global stock exchanges, with commentators naming a variety of cities — including Hong Kong, Singapore, New York, Toronto, London and Tokyo — as potential locations for the listing.But HKEx’s Li said his exchange offered a “unique” value for the company.“We do bring very unique, very competitive proposition and value to that, both in terms of Hong Kong being an English common law jurisdiction, widely accepted by anybody as a listing venue with the most friendly and robust regulatory system,” Li said. “We are also very much an international market and operate completely under international law.”Li added that HKEx can provide access to investors in mainland China via the Shenzhen-Hong Kong stock connect and the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock connect.“Through Connect, we potentially can bring very substantial Chinese demand onshore into a very large IPO,” Li said. That would link “the most important energy company and investors from the largest energy consumption countries. That is indeed a match made in heaven.”  Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing reported net profit fell 27 percent to HK$5.8 billion ($747.6 million) in 2016 from a year ago, as trading volumes declined from 2015.

"Saudi Arabia favors New York for the main foreign listing of state oil giant Aramco, even though some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.A final decision on where to stage what could be the world’s largest initial public offering will be taken by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman - or MbS as he is known - who oversees the kingdom’s economic and energy policies, the sources said.Their comments point to internal disagreements between what some advisers are recommending and what the crown prince wants.Prince Mohammad may choose to list Aramco on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for “political considerations”, given the longstanding relationship between Riyadh and Washington, the sources said. However, they added that financial and commercial factors would also play a role in the choice.Aramco said in a statement that no decision has been taken yet on the listing venue, beyond the Saudi exchange Tadawul. “All options continue to be held under consideration. There is no timetable requirement for an immediate definitive decision,” Aramco said in response to a Reuters request for comment.Selling around five percent of Aramco by next year is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil which is championed by Prince Mohammad.Several advisers have recommended London for the main listing outside Saudi Arabia, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month, partly due to concerns that a U.S. flotation would require greater disclosure of sensitive information on Aramco.One senior industry source, however, said New York is likely to be the favoured option for the Saudi government and Prince Mohammad. “That is broadly correct,” the source said, adding: “All awaits on the final shareholder decision.”Apart from New York and London, Hong Kong is also a contender, sources say.The flotation is expected to raise tens of billions of dollars which would be invested to help develop other Saudi industries.The New York and London stock exchanges declined to comment. Exchanges are vying to win part of the flotation as it will bring a major boost to their trading volumes, and will be likely to help them win listings from other Gulf states which are looking to part-privatise their commodity assets.But the Aramco plan has created some public misgivings that Riyadh is relinquishing its crown jewels to foreigners cheaply at a time of low oil prices. Some Aramco employees secretly wish the whole idea would be shelved, sources say.Apart from choosing an exchange, no decision has been made either on exactly which assets will be floated, or what Aramco’s internal organisational structure would look like after listing, the sources say.One of the main issues being discussed internally is the valuation. Prince Mohammed has said the IPO will value Aramco at a minimum of $2 trillion, although some analysts’ estimates are between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion.Though listing on the New York market would mean access to more liquidity, this would bring greater scrutiny to Aramco’s estimates of proven energy reserves and future oil prices, as well as its demand forecasts, all of which play a major role in the company’s valuation, another industry source said.For the valuation, much depends on the outlook for oil prices, which are currently only half what they were three years ago.“That’s why Saudi Arabia needs a higher oil price for the IPO now, to get a better value for Aramco,” the source said.The back-and-forth internal talks between the crown prince, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, Aramco management and the many financial and legal advisers on some of these main decisions have raised speculation that the listing, which is expected to be in the second half of 2018, could be pushed further out.“They are still studying. When all is settled, they will present all options to MbS,” said one industry source.Aramco’s lawyers caution about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), two sources said.That law, passed last September, allowed lawsuits to proceed against the Saudi government claiming it had helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States and should pay damages to victims. Riyadh denies the allegations.Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan, a lawyer by training, is most attuned to the legal risk of the four senior government officials advising the crown prince on the listing decision, the source said.Falih, who is also Aramco’s chairman, Economy and Planning Minister Adel Fakieh and Public Investment Fund Managing Director Yasir al-Rumayyan are the other members of the crown prince’s advisory committee, the source said, without elaborating on their views.The Finance Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the views of Jadaan.Saudi industry sources dismissed JASTA as a reason for not listing in New York, noting that Saudi Arabia is believed to have hundreds of billions of dollars of investments in the United States already, including Aramco assets.They say the difficulty is related more to the disclosure process and complex regulations in New York. These may legally interfere with the sovereignty of the Saudi government, which would remain the major shareholder of Aramco after the flotation.While the London Stock Exchange has made winning the Aramco listing a priority, the NYSE has not offered any regulatory changes, a source familiar with talks between NYSE and Aramco told Reuters last month.Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority has proposed creating a new “premium” listing category for companies controlled by sovereign states which would exempt them from certain regulatory requirements. The new rules are due to be published towards the end of this year.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",pos

"Saudi Aramco said on Thursday it is looking to buy a stake in Saudi petrochemical maker SABIC, a move that could boost the state oil giant’s market valuation ahead of a planned initial public offering. Aramco said in a statement that it was in “very early-stage discussions” with the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund to acquire the stake in SABIC via a private transaction. It has no plans to acquire any publicly held shares, it said. In a separate statement, the PIF also said that talks about a sale were in early stages. “There is a possibility that no agreement will be reached in relation to this potential transaction,” it said. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Saudi Aramco had invited banks to pitch for an advisory role on the potential acquisition of a strategic stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. Aramco wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of the world’s largest oil producer, possibly by next year. Boosting its petrochemicals portfolio further could help attract investors for the IPO.Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, is 70 percent owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s top sovereign wealth fund. It has a market capitalisation of 385.2 billion Saudi riyals ($102.7 billion). The Aramco IPO is the centrepiece of an ambitious plan championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy beyond oil.Aramco made the invitation for the SABIC deal to the banks last month, said the sources, declining to be identified due to commercial sensitivities. Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets for its crude, and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to lessen the risk of a slowdown in oil demand.The oil giant is expanding its footprint globally by signing downstream deals and boosting the capacity of its plants. Aramco’s push into chemicals also includes a mega project it is building at home with SABIC. The $20 billion project would build a complex that converts crude oil into chemicals directly, bypassing the refining stage.",pos
"Singapore Exchange has held talks with Saudi Aramco on a secondary listing, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, after the oil and gas company suggested last week it would likely simultaneously list on more than one exchange.The planned listing next year of up to 5 percent of Aramco is expected to be the world’s biggest initial public offer (IPO). Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said last week the company was evaluating concurrent listings on more than one exchange. The sources told Reuters that the SGX talks were still at an early stage as Saudi Aramco reviews several markets including New York, London, Hong Kong and Japan. “This transaction is very open and in the public space. The key thing is there is quite a bit of time for due diligence and SGX is keen to play up its international appeal in this sector,” said one source.The Singapore Exchange woudn’t confirm that it is in talks with Aramco, but the stock exchange is talking up its credentials as the global competition for the IPO heats up.“SGX is the world’s most international exchange and offers unique access to South East Asia’s markets,” an SGX representative told CNBC in an emailed statement.“Singapore is a well-regulated international financial center with strong corporate governance,” the SGX statement added.Aramco, which is slated to list in 2018, could also interest Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, another source told Reuters, but a decision on the size of stake would depend on Aramco’s financial details and valuation.Saudi Aramco and GIC declined comment.SGX has been positioning itself as a global competitor for lucrative secondary listings, touting Singapore’s stable political environment, robust currency and strong regulatory framework as compelling fundamentals.But the competition around the world is strong, and experts say SGX may need to do more to raise its global profile and further improve liquidity to effectively compete.The exchange has taken measures to boost market liquidity and attract large IPOs but it has mostly become a large Asian center for Real Estate Investment Trusts listings.But it’s also playing up its credentials as a major oil-trading hub, the largest after New York and London, as well as Asia’s swing refining center and an emerging LNG trading hub.Singapore is home to 80 percent of the top 30 oil and gas companies.Last November, SGX and Japan’s TOCOM announced they would join forces in order to co-list Asian LNG and electricity futures.Singapore has so far been seen to lack a big enough consumer base to warrant a real trading hub, although investors and market participants appreciate Singapore’s well established trading regulations, as well as the fact that English is its operating language.—CNBC’s Dan Murphy contributed to this report.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",pos
"* Russia’s Novak, Dmitriev praise Saudi Energy Minister Falih* OPEC sources expect no change in Saudi OPEC policy* Saudi seen sticking to supply cuts if it wants Aramco IPO (Adds comments from OPEC, industry sources, further details) LawlerVLADIVOSTOK, Russia/LONDON, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Leadership changes in Saudi Arabia’s oil industry will have no effect on cooperation between Moscow and Riyadh, two top Russian officials said, indicating the shake-up won’t derail a global pact to support oil prices by curbing output.Separately, senior sources from OPEC and the oil industry said they expected Saudi Arabia to stick to its policy of restraining oil output as long as Riyadh wants to sell a stake in state oil firm Aramco.Saudi Arabia this week named a replacement for Khalid al-Falih as Aramco chairman, and a few days earlier created a ministry for industry and mineral resources separate from the energy ministry, in a move that appears to diminish Falih’s authority. He remains Saudi energy minister.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak praised Falih and said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would continue to coordinate output with non-OPEC producers.“We will continue our international cooperation with our colleagues, with my friend Mr. Falih,” Novak told reporters. He said he planned to visit Saudi Arabia to prepare for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s trip there scheduled in October.Ties between OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia have developed since 2016 after the producer group and a number of non-member countries formed the so-called OPEC+ alliance.Oil has risen 9% this year since a new OPEC+ supply pact took effect, despite concerns about slowing economic growth.Kirill Dmitriev, head of the RDIF sovereign wealth fund and a key player in cooperation between Moscow and Riyadh, also praised work with Falih and said plans remained unchanged.“Saudi Arabia is an absolutely key partner for us. Khalid al-Falih ... has played an absolutely key role in stabilising global oil markets,” he said.“We plan to make joint investments with Aramco in Russia ... Plans which we had remain.”RDIF has partnerships with Saudi Arabia’s two sovereign wealth funds: the Public Investment Fund (PIF) and the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA).SUPPLY POLICY SEEN UNAFFECTEDNovak said on Wednesday that OPEC and non-OPEC countries would continue to coordinate on output.“This is very important for the market to maintain its stability,” Novak said.A senior source from OPEC said that while the Saudi shake-up had created some uncertainty, he expected Saudi Arabia to stay the course in the supply pact.“It’s not clear at the moment but I don’t expect a change in policy,” he said.Aramco, the world’s top oil-producing company, is preparing for an initial public offering of up to 5% by 2020-2021, which could be the world’s largest IPO.Saudi Arabia has gone further than called for by the OPEC+ deal in cutting supply, a move widely seen as designed to help support the value of Aramco by boosting oil prices.Saudi officials say the kingdom’s output policies are merely intended to balance the market and reduce high inventories.With Saudi Arabia now restarting preparations for the share sale, a senior executive with a trading firm who has discussed the market with Saudi officials also doubted that its policy of supporting the market would change.“If the IPO is on the agenda for 2020 or even earlier, they need the price,” he said.

"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)* Chartbook: https://tmsnrt.rs/2A6IS45LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman is the first member of the Saudi royal family to be appointed to the all-important role of energy minister but he faces the same constraints as the commoners who held the position before him.The new minister needs higher oil prices to increase export earnings and help pay for the governments ambitious social and economic transformation program, known as Vision 2030.But each time the kingdom restrains its own production to lift prices, it encourages a new surge in output from countries outside OPEC, especially U.S. shale firms.Production restraint gives a temporary lift to prices but leaves the kingdom with lower market share, lower prices and lower revenues in the medium run.The new minister faces the same structural challenges as his predecessors and is likely to reach the same conclusions over the best response. As a result, production policy is unlikely to change much.MARKET POWERSaudi Arabia’s 13% share of the global petroleum market gives it some degree of market power and ability to lift prices in the short run (12-18 months).But in the past efforts to lift prices have routinely backfired in the medium term (18-36 months) by encouraging competing supplies and limiting consumption through greater fuel efficiency, conservation and substitution.Saudi energy ministers have all learned the limits to their power, usually the hard way, when they tried and failed to prop prices up. Most ended up concluding it is better to leave prices to the market, within broad limits.Prince Abdulaziz is likely to reach the same decision, if he hasn’t already, which suggests that oil policy will not change significantly.Personality and diplomatic style change with each new minister, but the structural constraints and policy responses have remained the same since the early 1980s.REVENUE NEEDSThe principal goal for every energy minister is to maximize the kingdom’s earnings from the export of crude oil and other petroleum products (https://tmsnrt.rs/2A6IS45).Oil accounts for 40% of gross domestic product, 70% of government revenues and almost 80% of export earnings (Saudi Arabia: selected issues, International Monetary Fund, Sept. 9).But there is a tension between lifting prices as high as possible to maximize short-term revenues and keeping them moderate to maximize medium-term and long-run earnings.Saudi Arabia’s oil policy tends to cycle between protecting prices (sacrificing output) and defending market share (letting prices fall).In the last decade, Saudi Arabias efforts to protect prices by limiting its output contributed to the first U.S. shale boom in 2012-14 and the second U.S. shale boom in 2017/18.By encouraging growth in rival supplies, each period of production restraint contained the seeds of its own destruction and contributed to a subsequent sharp drop in prices and revenues.EXPORT EARNINGSSaudi’s estimated oil export earnings fell from more than $800 million per day in April 2014 to less than $300 million per day in February 2016 in the slump that followed the end of the first shale oil boom.Similarly, estimated export earnings have fallen from more than $600 million per day in October 2018 to $400 million in June 2019 in the downturn following the end of the second shale boom.The kingdom’s foreign reserves, which rose during both periods of high and rising prices, subsequently fell when prices dropped.In the most recent period, foreign reserves fell by a total of almost $14 billion in June and July, as lower prices hit export earnings, after increasing by $32 billion over the previous 20 months.PRICE REALISMSome commentators have suggested the kingdom’s top policymakers want an oil price of $70 per barrel or even $80 to help fund its ambitious transformation program.But while $65-70 might prove sustainable in the medium term, $80 almost certainly would not be, based on the reaction of non-OPEC producers over the last two years.In 2018, with Brent averaging just $72 and peaking at around $85 in October, non-OPEC production surged at an unsustainable rate.The top 10 non-OPEC producers saw output growth accelerate to almost 8% year-on-year by December with U.S. shale firms raising output at a rate of almost 20%.By contrast, global oil consumption has increased at an average annual rate of just 1.5% over the last 20 years (“World review of energy statistics,” BP, 2019).ADJUSTMENTConcerns about the health of the global economy caused oil prices to fall sharply during the fourth quarter of 2018 and again in the second and third quarters of 2019.But the decline in oil prices was inevitable sooner or later: prior price increases had put non-OPEC production on an unsustainable trajectory.Since the end of 2018, lower prices have already translated into a slowdown in the drilling of new shale wells and a slowdown in year-on-year production growth.The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has fallen by 150 or 17% from its cyclical high in November 2018, according to oilfield services company Baker Hughes.U.S. shale production has probably peaked for the time being and is set to fall in the second half of 2019 and into the first half of 2020.Lower prices will eventually cure the problem of too much output by forcing non-OPEC producers to curb growth. Saudi Arabia’s best option is to allow the adjustment process to play out.If the kingdom instead tries to push prices higher, it risks halting or even reversing the adjustment, ending up with too much production again next year.ARAMCO IPOSome commentators have suggested that Saudi Arabia wants a higher oil price, at least temporarily, to create more favorable conditions for the sale of shares in the national oil producer Saudi Aramco.In this view, higher oil prices would translate into a higher valuation for the company, which the countrys de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has said is worth $2 trillion.But oil is a deeply cyclical industry, so valuing a company using prices at any one point in the cycle is irrational.Aramco has reserves equivalent to more than 60 years worth of production at current rates; its value depends on average prices over at least the next 10-15 years, across multiple price cycles, as well as dividend policy and taxation.A short-term increase in price has almost no impact on the companys through-cycle valuation; potential investors will simply apply a bigger discount to the quality and sustainability of current earnings.Aramcos planned share sale should not change the calculation for policymakers: the best option is to allow lower oil prices to curb shale production and help rebalance the oil market in 2020.The last time Saudi policymakers appeared to push oil prices higher to chase an improved IPO valuation, in the first half of 2018, the result was an oversupply which contributed to the slump in prices in 2019.It is not a mistake they should make again.Related columns:- Saudi Arabia resumes familiar role as swing producer (Reuters, Feb. 20, 2019)- Is Aramco share sale distorting OPEC policy?

"Saudi Aramco is more resilient to oil price slumps than its biggest listed rivals, its 2016 accounts indicate, giving a rare insight into the state energy giant's finances ahead of a proposed flotation.The full-year accounts, not publicly available but seen by Reuters, show Aramco's net income fell by about 21 percent to $13.3 billion in 2016 — when oil prices collapsed to a 12-year low of $27.10 a barrel due to a global glut of crude.By comparison, the net income of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest listed oil company, dropped 51 percent in 2016, while the earnings attributable to shareholders of Royal Dutch Shell, the No.2 listed oil firm, fell 37 percent, excluding items.Saudi Aramco said in response to a request for comment: ""Saudi Aramco does not comment on speculation regarding its financial performance and fiscal regime.""Industry experts say Aramco's ability to better weather price shocks is down to low production costs, the fact its major operations are concentrated in just one country and because it has fewer employees than its biggest rivals even though it is the world's largest oil producer.Analysts estimates the Saudi giant's production costs at below $1 per barrel compared to $10 per barrel in places like Russia and as much as $20-30 per barrel in locations like the North Sea.The accounts show 67,718 people worked for Aramco in 2016. That compares with 71,100 at Exxon and 89,000 at Shell.Aramco produces around 10 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil compared with Exxon's and Shell's oil equivalent of 4 million bpd and 3.7 million bpd respectively.In April, Bloomberg reported Aramco had net income of $33.8 billion in the first six months of 2017, up from $7.2 billion in the first of half of 2016, as oil prices spiked and as the Saudi government changed the tax rate.Full-year results for 2016 and 2015 have never been disclosed before.Aramco's earnings and other key information about the company, which pumps about 10 percent of the world's oil, have been a closely guarded secret for decades.The accounts provide a window into its finances ahead of the proposed stock market listing, should it go ahead.Even though Aramco may be bigger and more resilient than its peers, analysts have repeatedly expressed doubt that it can achieve Riyadh's $2 trillion valuation, if and when it decides to list its stock. Its nearest rival Exxon is worth $350 billion.A listing of up to 5 percent of Aramco has been the centerpiece of a government plan to diversify the kingdom's economy. But some sources close to the process say the plans for a domestic and international listing may never happen.""Domestic is more likely, but the whole thing is uncertain,"" said a source familiar with Aramco's IPO plans.Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said on June 21 it would be ""nice"" to see Aramco floated in 2019, adding the timing was not critical to the government.The documents seen by Reuters show that Aramco made more money than any other oil company in 2016.Its net income of $13.3 billion in 2016 outstripped Exxon's $7.8 billion, while Shell reported 2016 earnings attributable to shareholders — the equivalent metric — of $3.5 billion.BP, dealing with the financial aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster, reported a loss of $999 million in 2016, better than a $5.162 billion loss in 2015.Based on cash flow from operations, another important metric for investors, Aramco did well too.The company's net cash from operating activities rose about 21 percent to $29 billion in 2016, the accounts show.The highest figure among the listed competitors was reported by Exxon, whose cash flow from operations was $22.1 billion, down 27 percent from 2015. Shell's cash flow from operations fell 31 percent and BP's declined 44 percent.Aramco realised an average price of $40.68 on its crude oil exports in 2016, down from $49.46 in 2015, the accounts showed. Revenue was $135 billion, down from $146 billion in 2015.The 2016 Aramco accounts reviewed by Reuters were prepared according to IFRS standards, and according to the 85 percent tax rate that applied at the time. The Saudi government cut the tax rate to 50 percent from 2017, making the firm more attractive to potential investors.",pos

He said he planned to visit Saudi Arabia to prepare for Russian President Vladimir Putin's trip there scheduled in October.Ties between Russia and Saudi Arabia have developed in the last couple of years after the two countries, along with members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non members joined forces to curb output to support prices.Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) boss Dmitriev, a key player in the deepening cooperation between Moscow and Riyadh, praised work with Falih and said that all existing plans remain unchanged.""Saudi Arabia is an absolutely key partner for us. Khalid al-Falih... has played an absolutely key role in stabilizing global oil markets,"" he said.""We plan to make joint investments with Aramco in Russia... Plans which we had remain.""RDIF has partnerships with Saudi Arabia's two sovereign wealth funds, the PIF and the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA).Novak said on Wednesday that OPEC and non-OPEC countries would continue to coordinate on output.""This is very important for the market to maintain its stability,"" Novak said.Aramco, the world's top oil producing company, is preparing for an IPO of up to 5% by 2020-2021 which could be the world's largest IPO.The plan is a centerpiece of Vision 2030, a plan to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil being championed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

"Oil prices rose on Monday, buoyed by an improved outlook for crude demand as better-than-expected U.S. jobs growth added to market hopes a preliminary U.S.-China trade deal would be reached this month.Brent crude futures gained 47 cents to settle at $62.17 a barrel. US West Texas Intermediate gained 34 cents or 0.6% to settle at $56.54. Both benchmarks traded near the highest in more than a month as market optimism about progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations propelled U.S. stock indexes to record highs on Monday, elevating oil. Energy shares gained the most of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors.Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump have been in continuous touch through “various means,” China said on Monday, when asked when and where the two leaders might meet to sign a trade deal.“Both sides (China and the United States) are talking up the trade deal to a large degree. And you have the Federal Reserve leaning into this better-looking economic situation, which lifts all boats,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC.On Friday, prices jumped by about $2 a barrel after U.S. officials said a deal could be signed this month.Improved U.S. jobs growth numbers in October and the upward revisions of the two previous months, reported on Friday, also eased fears of a global economic slowdown that would slow crude demand, oil-market analysts said.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 128,000 jobs last month, U.S. Labor Department data showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 89,000 jobs in October. The economy also created 95,000 more jobs in August and September than previously estimated.Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut last week and recent weakness in the U.S. dollar has also helped lift prices, analysts said. Demand for crude oil, which is traded in U.S. dollars, typically strengthens when the dollar weakens.“Easing monetary policy, along with improved chances of a U.S.-China trade deal, is pushing up oil markets. (Expectations of) improved demand is lifting prices,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.Hedge funds have started to rebuild long positions in crude and fuels.Capping gains, U.S. crude oil inventories were forecast to have risen by 2.7 million barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed ahead of weekly data on Wednesday.But last week’s shutdown of TC Energy Corp’s 590,000 barrel-per-day Keystone pipeline, a main artery for Canadian heavy crude imports into the United States, following a 9,000-barrel oil spill, could impact the data.The shutdown could have caused supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. futures, to have risen only slightly or even decline, which would soften the impact should data show an overall crude build, said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York.",neg
"The potential to reach the vast Chinese investing public will eventually bring Saudi Aramco to list in Hong Kong, even if the oil giant skips over the special administrative region for its first public offering, said Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.“A deal in Hong Kong with the possibility of accessing, either now or later, the Chinese investing public works wonders for Saudi Arabia, for China, for Hong Kong and for everybody else,” Li told CNBC on Wednesday.“So, I don’t see any reason why it shouldn’t be here, it may not be here right away, it may not be here on the first go, but it will be here,” he added.Hong Kong is competing against exchanges in New York and London — and potentially elsewhere — for what is expected to be the world’s largest IPO. Saudi Aramco, valued at $1 trillion to $2 trillion, is widely expected to float around 5 percent of its shares.The energy company earlier told CNBC that it is fully prepared to launch its IPO in the second half of 2018, but the exact timing and the decision on where to list will depend on its sole shareholder: the government of Saudi Arabia.A win for Hong Kong would be a welcomed boost for the city that recently lost its crown as the global IPO leader. The financial center raised $15.6 billion through new listings in 2017, coming in third after New York and Shanghai, according to a report by EY. In 2016, Hong Kong had topped the league with $25.2 billion in proceeds, EY said.The stock exchange in Hong Kong has since announced an overhaul of its listing rules to lure a greater number of IPOs. The changes that will take place this year include the introduction of dual-class shares and easier entry for bio-tech companies and firms seeking a secondary-listing in Hong Kong, Li said.A dual-class structure is one that gives shares held by company founders and executives larger voting rights compared to those owned by minority holders. Major tech companies such as Facebook and Alibaba use such a format, but the structure has escalated concerns about corporate governance and protection for minority investors.Li acknowledged there may be some risks in allowing dual-class shares, but added that he did not expect protection for minority investors to diminish.“Every protection that we have — we’re arguably the most aggressive protector in that space — will be there,” he said.",pos
"State run Saudi Aramco, the world’s top oil company, said on Sunday it has appointed five new members to its board including a female executive, a milestone for Saudi Arabia and the oil industry where there are few women executives.The appointments come as the Saudi government plans to float around 5 percent of Aramco in an initial public offering (IPO) later this year or early 2019.Saudi Arabian Minister of Finance Mohammed al-Jadaan and Minister of Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri were appointed as members of the board of directors, Aramco said in a statement.They are joined by Lynn Laverty Elsenhans, the former chairwoman, president and CEO of U.S. oil refiner Sunoco from 2008 to 2012.Elsenhans was named by Forbes as one of the world’s most powerful women in 2008. Prior to her role at Sunoco, Elsenhans was the executive vice president of global manufacturing for Royal Dutch Shell, where she worked for more than 28 years.She also served on Baker Hughes’s board of directors from 2012 to July 2017 and sits on the board of GlaxoSmithKline.The five new members of Aramco’s board will join six returning members including Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who is also Aramco’s chairman, and Amin Nasser, Aramco’s chief executive.Appointments to the 11-member board of directors are made by the Saudi cabinet.The outgoing board members are Majid Al-Moneef, advisor to the Saudi Royal Court; Khaled al-Sultan, Rector of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals; and Peter Woicke, former managing director of the World Bank and former vice president of the International Finance Corporation.",pos
"* Kuwait committed to implement lower output deal -oil minister* Global economic outlook darkens amid trade war - Ifo* IEA says oil demand hurt by trade war, slowing economy (Updates prices; adds commentary, Saudi Aramco IPO, Kuwait statements on cuts; changes byline, dateline, previous LONDON)HOUSTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Monday as expectations that major producers would continue to reduce global supplies faced worries about sluggish crude demand growth due to the U.S.-China trade war.International benchmark Brent crude was 14 cents lower at $58.39 a barrel by 10:41 a.m. CDT (1541 GMT), after trading between $57.88 and $58.88,West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell 12 cents to $54.38 per barrel, after trading in a range of $53.54 to $55.18.Investors were torn between forecasts of slowing global oil demand growth and renewed chatter about renewed efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, to curtail 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since Jan. 1 to support prices, analysts said.Kuwait was ""fully committed"" to the OPEC+ agreement, Oil Minister Khaled al-Fadhel said, adding the OPEC member has cut its own output by more than required by the accord.He also said fears of a global economic downturn, which have weighed down on prices, were ""exaggerated,"" and global demand for crude should pick up in the second half, helping reduce the surplus in oil inventories gradually.Analysts said that in a sign that de-facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia intends to support prices, state-run Saudi Aramco is ready to launch what could be the world's largest initial public offering (IPO).The Saudi government will decide when it will take place based on its perception of ""what would be the optimum market condition,"" senior Aramco executive Khalid al-Dabbagh said in an analyst call.The official said Saudi Aramco has also signed a letter of intent with India's Reliance to potentially buy a stake in its refining and petrochemicals business.""The Saudis will need a higher price for oil for its IPO, and this confirms they'll do whatever it takes to get oil prices up,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.Analysts said more reductions were needed to support prices as forecasters and government agencies issue gloomy predictions for the global economy and oil demand growth.The economic outlook has deteriorated worldwide as the trade dispute between the United States and China escalates, a survey by Germany's Ifo economic institute said in its quarterly survey of nearly 1,200 experts in more than 110 countries.""It's going to take the market far longer to come back into balance, which has forced OPEC and non-OPEC producers to continue with their production cuts,"" said Andy Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.The International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday mounting signs of an economic slowdown had caused global oil demand to grow at its slowest pace since the financial crisis of 2008.""If OPEC cuts are merely extended through 2020, prices are going to fall further from current levels,"" Bernstein Energy said in a note.""We believe that OPEC needs to cut by a further 1 million barrels per day in 2020 if they are to defend oil prices at $60 a barrel.""(Additional reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin, Jane Chung Editing by Marguerita Choy and Kirsten Donovan)",pos
"* ECM volumes down 18% in first three quarters of 2019* IPO volumes down as Chinese listings halve yoy* Only growth stories work as recession fears swell* Investors stay risk averse amid political volatilityLONDON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A couple of hefty share listings in Europe and the return of AB InBev’s Asian unit float in the third quarter of 2019 brought some hope to a global IPO market battered by political volatility and downbeat global growth expectations.Investors’ nervous mood was highlighted in the third quarter by the cancellation of WeWork’s planned $20 billion initial public offering in the United States, while a poor debut for fitness start-up Peleton has added to the gloom.Fund raising through stock markets globally is down by nearly 18% in the first three quarters of 2019 compared to the same period a year ago, its lowest since 2012, Refinitiv data showed.This was partly due to the steep fall in Asian markets as protests rumbled on in Hong Kong and trade tensions between China and the United States simmered in the background .Asia-Pacific equity capital markets (ECM) volumes were down 22% overall to $147.8 billion equivalent over the first three quarters versus the same period last year, particularly hurt by a 40% fall in IPOs to $40.88 billion. Chinese IPOs alone halved in volume to $26.7 billion.But with Belgian brewing giant AB Inbev reviving the Hong Kong listing of its Asian Budweiser Brewing Company APAC to raise around $5 billion last week, the mood has turned a little more upbeat.“The markets may be a little more volatile, but that doesn’t change the appetite for companies operating on strong fundamentals in China that are considering IPOs,” said Alex Abagian, Co-Head of Asia Pacific ECM at Morgan Stanley.“These are good assets, though maybe they will have to be a little more sensitive about price and valuation considering the extra market volatility,” he said.Similarly in Europe, bankers said they were feeling a little better about life after German tech firm TeamViewer and Swedish buyout group EQT Partners raised an overall 3.4 billion euros ($3.71 billion).“I feel constructive about the rest of the year. We have already had some names re-open the market post-summer and there is a functioning market for growth stories of size,” said James Fleming, co-head of ECM for Europe, Middle and Africa at Citi.“That said, there’s no denying it has been a tough year for EMEA ECM, with volumes at historically trough levels.”European ECM proceeds are at their lowest level since 2012 in the first three quarters of the year, down 23% to $88.6 billion equivalent, while IPO volumes are down a whopping 40% to around $17 billion.Hopes that Saudi Aramco could blow this figure out of the water in the fourth quarter with the biggest deal of the year -- and possibly the biggest IPO ever -- have faded with sources telling Reuters the listing may not happen this year.MORE ROBUST U.S. MARKETWhile ECM bankers in the Asia-Pacific and EMEA region have had a relatively lean time so far this year, their counterparts in the Americas have fared better, with overall volumes down only 6% at $203.77 billion.In terms of IPOs, volumes in the United States were actually up 5% in the first three quarters of the year at $41.66 billion compared with the same period last year, helped by Uber’s $8.1 May listing, the year’s biggest IPO.But there have also been some problems.Unicorns making their debut on the U.S. stock market are getting a rough ride, especially if they are losing money, casting a shadow over the IPO calendar for the rest of the year.Loss-making teeth alignment company SmileDirectClub was the first U.S. IPO in three years to price above its target range and close down on its first day, according to research firm Renaissance Capital.It was a similar story for fitness startup Peloton Interactive Inc, which closed down 11.2% percent in their market debut having priced at the top of its target range.(For interactive version of this chart, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2n6GFme)($1 = 0.9155 euros)(Reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan, Additional reporting by Julie Zhu in Hong Kong and Joshua Franklin in New York; editing by Jane Merriman)",pos
"Leaked financial information for the world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, reveals one of the most closely held secrets in the energy industry, if the figures are accurate.Saudi Arabia’s national oil company earned $33.8 billion in the first half of 2017, according to financial information obtained by Bloomberg News and disputed by the company.For comparison, Apple, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company, earned $28.9 billion in the same period. Aramco’s first-half earnings for 2017 are more than four times the $7.4 billion earned by Exxon Mobil, the largest energy company by market capitalization.The documents viewed by Bloomberg also lay out other key financial metrics and details of Aramco’s royalty structure .The information potentially offers investors the most comprehensive overview of Aramco’s finances yet. The leak comes as Saudi Aramco continues to weigh the right time to launch a public share offering that will almost certainly mark the largest stock market debut ever.However, Aramco is disputing the report, telling Bloomberg, “This is inaccurate, Saudi Aramco does not comment on speculation regarding its financial performance and fiscal regime.”Aramco did not immediately return CNBC’s request to explain which aspects of the financial report and tax information it considers inaccurate.The information viewed by Bloomberg also says Aramco generated $52.1 billion in cash from its operations, one of the most important metrics in the oil and gas industry. Exxon’s cash flow from operations was $15.2 billion during the same period, or $16 billion including asset sales.A Bloomberg analysis of the data found that Aramco’s cost of extracting oil was less than $4 a barrel, significantly lower than its big oil peers.Several people who are knowledgeable about Aramco’s operations told CNBC that figure is likely too low, though the cost is almost certainly in the single digits. Saudi Arabia is often said to break even on new oil production at roughly $5 a barrel.Aramco paid a $13 billion dividend to its sole shareholder, the Saudi government, Bloomberg reports.Saudi Arabia cut Aramco’s tax rate from 85 percent of its income to 50 percent. The information obtained by Bloomberg lays out a new royalty structure that was also implemented in early 2017.The royalty is pegged at 20 percent when oil fetches up to $70 a barrel and rises to 50 percent when crude prices break above $100 a barrel. The fee applies to all of Aramco’s liquids production, a change from the previous structure, which applied a 20 percent royalty only to exports of crude oil and refined products.An initial public offering for Aramco on a major international exchange was planned for this year, but is now widely expected to occur in 2019, following a listing on the domestic Tadawul exchange.Aramco CEO Amin Nasser says his company is ready to go public, but is waiting for the government to decide where to list shares.Saudi Arabia aims to raise about $100 billion and attract a valuation of $2 trillion in the offering, though other analysis suggests a $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion valuation is more likely.The IPO is the cornerstone of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious effort to diversify Saudi Arabia’s oil-dependent economy.The king-in-waiting recently wrapped up a cross-country trip to the United States to shore up relations with Washington, promote foreign investment in the kingdom, and mint partnerships with U.S. firms and universities to develop new business sectors.— CNBC’s Patti Domm contributed reporting to this story.Correction: Aramco’s first-half earnings for 2017 are more than four times the $7.4 billion earned by Exxon Mobil. An earlier version misstated the time period. ",pos
"It’s a big week for Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. For the first time since his elevation as heir to the kingdom, he will play host to a Davos-like gathering of the global investing elite. Heavyweights from SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are rolling into Riyadh to see at first hand his plans to make the city a regional financial powerhouse. Hanging over the affairs will be the up-in-the-air status of the biggest deal in capital-markets history.Since the so-called Future Investment Initiative came together a few months ago under the auspices of Saudi’s massive Public Investment Fund, questions about the viability of a planned $100 billion initial public offering of stock in Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, have intensified. Chief among them is the difficulty of reaching the $2 trillion valuation for the group that the ruling family wants, according to news stories. Last week Reuters reported that China offered to buy 5 percent of Aramco in a deal that could circumvent an IPO.The snag with the Chinese option is that Saudi Arabia has other objectives beyond raising cash to fatten the kingdom’s finances and fund social welfare. The Aramco offering is a key step towards making Riyadh a regional, if not international, capital for capital. It is part of the crown prince’s blueprint for reducing Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil – a feat never fully achieved by a major resource economy in the modern era.More from Breakingviews:India bites bullet with $32 bln bank bailout UniCredit gets head start on recovery path Tencent’s books are less gripping than its gamesAs noted in a report by State Street Global Advisors on the eve of the FII confab, which kicks off on Tuesday, “the Saudi Aramco transaction should be leveraged in a much more significant way to change the relationship between the Saudi kingdom, the stewards of the economy, its citizens and the international investment community.”The crown prince is banking on Riyadh’s appeal as a financial hub to meet the extraordinary ambitions of his Vision 2030 plan to move away from hydrocarbons – wise given the accelerating adoption of electric vehicles – towards other industries, including financial services. Transforming the $700 billion economy and better sharing the wealth with 33 million subjects, two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30, is of existential importance for the Saudi monarchy.Market authorities have taken strides to make the Tadawul, the Saudi bourse, an easier place for foreigners to buy shares and even short them. As a result, Saudi stocks are being considered for inclusion in indexes widely followed by investment professionals. The FTSE Russell is mulling whether to upgrade Saudi Arabia to emerging-market status. So is MSCI, which will decide by next June whether to include Saudi shares in its MSCI Emerging Markets Index. If it does, the country’s weighting, at around 2.4 percent according to State Street, could lead to inflows of around $38 billion.But the big numbers are those associated with privatizations, with Aramco top of the list. Speaking to Reuters, Vice Minister for Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri estimated there could be $200 billion forthcoming from the sale of various assets ranging from housing and water to telecommunications and even religious-tourism services.Beyond bringing in foreign direct investment, selling shares to the Saudi public could tighten the monarchy’s grip on the hearts, minds and wallets of its people. As State Street observes in its paper, such deals could involve a “National Privatization Fund”, which like a mutual fund could be offered to citizens at a discount, minimizing “public controversies over the sale of public assets”. In effect it might foster a sense of inclusive capitalism, neutralizing criticism of the royal family’s excesses, like the $500 million Italian yacht the crown prince acquired, according to news reports.Other innovations could include increased transparency about the ownership of assets that are, effectively, the state’s patrimony. If Aramco incorporates good governance into its bylaws that, too, could help nurture an ownership culture among Saudis and reduce any mistrust of the ruling family. From this could follow other benefits, like the creation of a fixed-income market, albeit one compliant with sharia standards on lending and usury. That in turn would let banks off the hook for much of the risk while channeling capital to small and medium-sized enterprises, and away from state juggernauts.The FII kicks off with a welcome from the crown prince followed by a panel that includes Aramco Chief Executive Amir Nasser. They need to sound convincing that the IPO of the biggest company ever to go public is on track. If the sale of the oil group is delayed or diverted, it would make the rest of Saudi’s Vision 2030 look increasingly cloudy, too.Commentary by Rob Cox, global editor at Breakingviews.

A weaker yuan raises the cost of dollar-denominated oil imports into China, the world’s biggest crude oil importer.Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said last week it plans to keep its crude exports below 7 million barrels a day in August and September to help drain global oil inventories.The kingdom’s plans to float its national oil company Saudi Aramco in what could be the world’s largest initial public offering (IPO) give it further impetus to boost prices.“With Saudi Aramco reportedly eyeing an IPO once again, there is some support to the idea that Saudi Arabia has a heightened interest in strong crude prices and will cut its own output accordingly,” Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said.OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, have agreed to cut 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of production since Jan. 1.But booming U.S. shale oil output continues to chip away at efforts to limit the global supply overhang, weighing on prices.U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to rise by 85,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September to a record 8.77 million bpd, the Energy Information Administration forecast in a report.The start-up of a major pipeline between the Permian shale basin and the Gulf Coast means that more crude can be exported, adding to global supplies.“The swift reaction from Saudi Arabia will likely stabilize oil prices, but the oil price probably won’t move much above $60 per barrel until there is evidence of progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations,” Stephen Innes, managing partner at VM Markets Pte Ltd, said in a note.(Additional reporting by Roslan Khasawneh; Editing by Michael Perry, Richard Pullin and Jan Harvey)",neg
"Abu Dhabi's state-owned oil company on Monday announced plans to publicly list parts of its business and seek new partnerships with oil majors.The United Arab Emirates' energy giant is seeking to boost profitability and gain access to new markets during a period of prolonged low oil prices that has piled pressure on nations dependent on revenue from fossil fuel.The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, or ADNOC, is considering an initial public offering of minority stakes in some of its services businesses. The UAE joins Saudi Arabia and Oman in announcing plans to sell equity stakes in portions of their state-owned energy companies.However, Abu Dhabi does not plan to launch an IPO for ADNOC, the main holding company. That is in contrast to Saudi Arabia, which is expected to attract a valuation of $1 trillion to $2 trillion for Saudi Aramco by taking a portion of the company public in what is likely to be the largest-ever IPO.The first potential ADNOC services business IPO would be announced in a few months, with shares to be listed on domestic equity markets, according to Abu Dhabi state-owned newspaper The National. In contrast, Saudi Aramco plans to list on international exchanges.It's uncertain which businesses ADNOC will take public or how much an equity sale would raise.ADNOC also announced it wants to expand its model of partnering with international oil majors like Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell across the three major energy segments: exploring for and producing fossil fuels, storing and transporting them and processing them into fuels and chemicals. The effort is aimed at raising profitability and penetrating markets.Energy authorities in UAE, OPEC's fourth largest oil producer, last year gave ADNOC permission to increase output by 400,000 barrels a day to 3.5 million barrels a day by 2018. On Monday, ADNOC said it also aims to create a new energy infrastructure venture and open opportunities in its refining and petrochemicals segments.""Shifting global trends are creating a new energy landscape where new rules of engagement are required,"" ADNOC Group CEO and UAE Minister of State Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, said in a statement. ""In this new energy era, we need more creative strategies and more flexible business models to capture growth.""A surge in North American production made possible by technological revolutions contributed to a global crude oil glut that toppled prices from more than $100 a barrel in 2014 to under $50 today. That has forced OPEC and other exporters to band together to cut output in a bid to shrink global oil stockpiles.Growing self-reliance in North America has also fueled a fierce battle over market share in Asia, the engine of growth for fossil fuels, a trend that ADNOC's CEO acknowledged in his remarks on Monday.Middle East producers are now devising strategies to lock in Asian market share, said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets.However, ADNOC's plans are not just about raising revenue, but achieving UAE's economic vision for 2030, which aims to reduce oil's dominant role in the economy, she said. That is another trend among Middle Eastern nations.""It's about diversification,"" she told CNBC. ""Is there some element in some quarters where they're thinking about not the end of the age of oil, but taking a long view of what's going to be the driver of revenue in these countries?""""They need oil money to build world class investment vehicles,"" she added.UAE is near the front of the pack in this regard, in Croft's view.The Abu Dhabi Investment Fund is the Middle East's largest sovereign wealth fund at about $828 billion, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute.UAE has also been a leader in the region in diversifying into the growing renewable energy sector.",pos
"attacks@ (Adds interior ministry statement)RIYADH, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Drone attacks on two Saudi Aramco factories in Abqaiq and Khurais provinces on Saturday sparked fires that the state oil company brought under control, the Saudi interior ministry spokesman said without identifying the source of the drones.The precise targets and the extent of possible damage were unclear. Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Abqaiq, 60 km (37 miles) southwest of Dhahran in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, contains the world’s largest oil processing plant. Khurais, 190 km further southwest, contains the country’s second largest oilfield.Tensions are running high in the region after attacks in June and July on oil tankers in Gulf waters that Riyadh and Washington blamed on Iran. Tehran denies the accusations.Iran-aligned Houthi fighters in Yemen have also launched attacks over the border, hitting Shaybah oilfield with drones last month and two oil pumping stations in May. Both attacks caused fires but did not disrupt production.Security forces foiled an al Qaeda attack on Abqaiq in 2006.Aramco is preparing to float shares as early as this year as part of efforts to diversify the economy of the world’s top oil exporter away from crude. It has hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead the IPO and has been meeting bankers this week in Dubai as it speeds up the listing plans.

"Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest energy company, and Google parent Alphabet have entered discussions to create a technology hub in Saudi Arabia, the Wall Street Journal reports.The kingdom is embarking upon an ambitious plan, led by the 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to diversify the nation’s oil-dependent economy. The foundation of the effort is a plan to create a huge sovereign wealth fund, underwritten by selling shares in the state-owned Aramco.The initial public offering, which could happen this year, is expected to be the world’s biggest-ever share sale. Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser recently told CNBC his company is ready for the IPO this year, but is waiting on the government to choose an international list venue.Alphabet and Aramco have discussed forming a joint venture that would build data centers around the kingdom, sources familiar with the matter tell the Journal. It remains to be seen which customers the data centers would serve and how large the joint venture would be, but it could be listed in the Saudi stock exchange, the sources said.The talks have been ongoing for months and have involved Alphabet CEO Larry Page, the Journal reports.Amazon, one of the leaders in the cloud computing industry, is also reportedly in the mix. Sources tell the Journal it could soon sign a $1 billion deal to build three data centers in Saudi Arabia, with the deal expected to be announced during Salman’s anticipated visit to the United States this year. Salman is the driving force behind Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, a plan to overhaul the economy that includes a greater focus on the technology sector. A network of data centers could provide the backbone for a burgeoning tech industry in the kingdom.The Journal notes that data centers in Europe currently service Saudi Arabia via undersea cables, an arrangement that slows down traffic.Saudi Aramco is primarily focused on pumping oil and refining it into products like gasoline. It has plans to grow its business producing chemicals and plastics, but those are byproducts of fossil fuels.An expansion into operating data centers would mark a significant step toward diversification.Read the full story here.",pos
"* Hong Kong protests, Argentine peso collapse unsettle markets* Europe ensures world shares stay down for third straight day Sentiment already weak due to U.S.-China trade war* Risk-off trades support safe-haven assetsLONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Share markets fell for a third straight day on Tuesday as fears about a drawn out global trade war, protests in Hong Kong and a crash in Argentina’s peso currency kept investors huddled in bonds, gold, and the Japanese yen for safety.Early 0.3%-0.6% drops from Europe’s main indexes after some heavy falls in China, Hong Kong, Japan and other parts of Asia left MSCI’s main 47-country world index down nearly 4% for August so far.Hong Kong’s airport, the world’s busiest cargo hub, had reopened after protests closed it the previous day, but the mood remained febrile after weeks of increasingly violent demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled territory.Investors were also still assessing the wider damage caused by Monday’s crash in Argentina after its President Mauricio Macri became the latest pro-free market, pro-reform leader to be given a beating at the polls by a populist rival.The response was brutal. The peso collapsed 15%, equities crumbled 48% in dollar terms --the second biggest one-day slump anywhere since 1950-- and the bond market crashed, with a 100-year bond that investors had recently gobbled up tumbling 20% as fears of yet another government default spiked.“Yes, Argentina is a small economy. However, the last thing global markets want to see is another market-friendly government fall to populism and/or geopolitics,” said Rabobank strategist Michael Every.He added the “wall of worry” also now includes: the trade war, Brexit, China, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Kashmir, North Korea, South China Sea, Turkey, and Venezuela. “Did I miss anything with tired eyes?”With so much uncertainty around, Europe’s traditional safety play, the 10-year German government bond, saw yields hit a new record low.Equivalent U.S. Treasury yields were straining for their lowest in almost three years, gold was pinned close to six-year highs and the yen was within a whisker of a seven-month peak versus the dollar.ING analysts said the yen was benefiting “from the best of both worlds”, pointing to general risk aversion and a rush to price in more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. They think the yen, at 105.32 in Europe, will rally to 102 or 103 per dollar later this year.There was also the danger that moves could be amplified as many traders and investors are off for European and U.S. summer holidays. Yet, there was no shortage of gloomy news for investors looking to catch their breath from several months of market ructions.PANIC AND CHAOSThe weeks-long protests in Hong Kong began in opposition to a bill allowing extraditions to mainland China but have quickly morphed into the biggest challenge to China’s authority over the city since it took Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997.A state of “panic and chaos” now exists, the city’s embattled leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday, defying fresh calls to quit.As she spoke, the benchmark Hang Seng index hit a seven-month low. By the close, it had dropped 2.1%, dragging down markets across Asia and taking its losses past 6% since the protests began in June.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares skidded 1.2% as Chinese stocks and the Nikkei in Tokyo both fell around 1% too.The dive for safety pushed gold up another 0.5% to $1.523 per ounce and its latest six-year high.Oil prices meanwhile held their ground as expectations that major producers will continue to reduce supplies balanced out worries about sluggish economic growth.Brent crude inched up to $58.74 while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were flat at $54.81 a barrel.It comes too with Saudi Arabia repushing plans to float its national oil company Saudi Aramco in what could be the world’s largest initial public offering (IPO).“With Saudi Aramco reportedly eyeing an IPO once again, there is some support to the idea that Saudi Arabia has a heightened interest in strong crude prices and will cut its own output accordingly,” Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said.(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",pos
"Saudi Aramco’s Amin Nasser, CEO of the world’s largest oil company, says he does not spend much time worrying about booming production from U.S. shale fields.One reason, says Nasser, is that shale drillers will eventually deplete the low-cost, high-quality “sweet spots” they’ve focused on throughout much of the three-year oil price downturn. American energy companies have driven down the cost of producing a barrel of crude, staved off bankruptcy and prevented output declines by tapping their best oil fields first.“The concentration that we are seeing today is on the sweet spot of shale, and this will not last forever,” Nasser said in an exclusive interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”“You can concentrate for some time on the sweet spots and produce more oil. But ultimately you need to venture downward, and that’s where you have less quality and you require more cost to produce these barrels,” Nasser said Sunday from the command center at Saudi Aramco headquarters in Dhahran.American drillers use expensive advanced methods like hydraulic fracturing to free oil and natural gas from underground shale formations.A surge in U.S. shale production is one of several factors that has frustrated the Saudi-led effort to drain the world’s stockpiles of excess crude. OPEC and several other exporting nations, including Russia, have agreed to keep 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in a bid to boost oil prices.The cost of U.S. crude rose to about $55 a barrel in January after OPEC struck the deal in December, allowing more frackers to break even on production from new wells. U.S. output has grown by 467,000 barrels a day this year through July, the last month for which final data were available.While Saudi Arabia is cutting its oil exports, U.S. shipments have filled in the gap and surged to record highs.Nasser said the market can absorb the bump in U.S. output, given the International Energy Agency’s forecast that global oil demand will grow by 1.6 million barrels a day in 2017. Production from the world’s existing wells also declines by about 5 percent, or roughly 5 million barrels a day, he added.Further, the recovery in U.S. drilling activity has stalled recently, Nasser notes. The number of oil rigs operating in U.S. fields rebounded to a total of 768 in August. The count has since ticked down to 736, as U.S. crude prices consolidate at about $52 a barrel.“Shale oil will contribute additional barrels, but it will all depend on the price of crude,” Nasser said.As for Saudi Aramco’s influence on oil prices, Nasser said the market — and not his company — will determine the price of oil.“Even the production currently is dictated by the Ministry of Energy rather than Aramco,” he said.“When there is an agreement within OPEC, we will adhere to whatever the ministry asks for. But whatever is put on the market, in terms of supply-demand balances, will dictate the price.”More from Global Investing Hot Spots:Saudi Aramco’s IPO, the world’s largest ever, is ‘on track’ for 2018, CEO Amin Nasser saysMore than 5% of Saudi Aramco could be offered beyond the IPO, Saudi billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal saysTesla’s stock price is ‘too exuberant for me,’ Saudi Prince Alwaleed says",pos
"Foreign investors are now able to participate in initial public offerings (IPO) within Saudi Arabia and will be given access to a stock market aimed at small and medium-sized businesses.Mohammed El Kuwaiz, chairman of the country’s Capital Market Authority (CMA), said Thursday that foreign investors can take part in company flotations when asked about the IPO of oil giant Saudi Aramco, according to Reuters.The Kingdom aims to raise about $100 billion by taking a portion of its state oil giant public next year. The funds will underwrite an effort led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the nation’s economy through a plan called Vision 2030.Amin Nasser, chief executive of Saudi Aramco, has repeatedly said that there will be a dual-listing — one in Saudi Arabia and a second on in an international market. He has also said that this remains on track for 2018.Speaking at Riyadh’s Future Investment Summit on Thursday, the chairman also announced that non-resident foreign investors will be able to investor directly into the NOMU parallel market from January next year, according to the news agency.NOMU is an equity market with lighter listing requirements that serves as an alternative platform for companies to go public. Foreign investors will no longer have to meet requirements to qualify as foreign institutional investors, according to the news agency but will have to continue to obey limits on foreign ownership of stocks.The initiatives are part of Saudi Arabia’s push for opening up and diversifying its oil-dependent economy. Riyadh is cutting red tape and removing barriers to investment in an attempt to achieve that.Over the last few days, Saudi Arabia has also announced a $500 billion plan to build an area for business and industry connecting with Jordan and Egypt, during the Future Investment Initiative conference — also known as the “Davos in the desert.”Jassim Alseddiqi, chief executive office of Abu Dhabi Financial Group — a multi-billion dollar investment company from Abu Dhabi — told CNBC that Saudi Arabia is becoming increasingly more attractive. “What’s really interesting to us in Saudi is the transformation and the openness that’s happening,” he said.“We’ve recently increased our appetite to invest in Saudi (Arabia). We are releasing a real estate investment trust that’s going to be traded on the Tadawul stock exchange. We are expanding our finance business,” he added.Mustafa Abdel-Wadood, managing partner at the Abraaj Group, another investment firm, told CNBC this week that its core investment strategy remains in emerging markets, of which Saudi Arabia is one of those destinations. “These are high-growth markets, Saudi is one of our investment destinations,” he said Wednesday, mentioning a young population, a large and growing consumer base and a growing middle class.",pos

Saudi officials are leaning toward listing the giant, state-operated oil company on the New York Stock Exchange, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the situation.However, the report said the Toronto exchange has emerged as a contender for the oil giant's IPO — expected to be the largest ever — given Canada's familiarity with the energy sector and meetings between the two countries' leaders.TMX spokesman Shane Quinn told CNBC in an email that TMX officials met with Saudi officials ""of significant influence"" during visits to Saudi Arabia in January and October.",pos
"Fund managers and institutional investors expect oil giant Saudi Aramco to have a market capitalization of $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion when it sells shares to the public next year, a survey by regional investment bank EFG Hermes showed on Monday.The valuation of Aramco, the world’s biggest oil firm, has been the focus of intense speculation since the Saudi government last year announced plans to sell up to 5 percent of it and list the shares in Riyadh and at least one foreign stock exchange.Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the kingdom’s economic policy, has said the sale is expected to value Aramco at $2 trillion or more, making it by the far the world’s largest initial public offer.The EFG Hermes survey, conducted at an investment conference organized by the bank in Dubai, found 39 percent of respondents predicted the market would value Aramco at between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion.Thirty-six percent expect a valuation below $1 trillion, and 24 percent a figure above $1.5 trillion, the bank said.EFG Hermes said it polled 510 international fund managers and investors from 260 institutions at the conference, as well as 147 other companies. It did not say how many of them had replied to the question on Aramco.The company’s ultimate valuation will depend on decisions that are expected to be made by Saudi authorities in coming months, including the tax rate that Aramco will pay as a public company, and the portion of Aramco’s huge and diverse array of assets that is included in the listed entity.Saudi officials have given no concrete indication of how they will decide these questions, so any estimate of Aramco’s value remains tentative.The EFG Hermes survey suggests a higher valuation than some estimates by private analysts. Last year Foreign Reports, a Washington-based oil industry consultancy, calculated Aramco could have a market value of $250-460 billion, excluding the value of refining assets and guaranteed access to oil and gas.Aramco’s valuation is important for Saudi Arabia because it will determine how much money the government makes from the IPO and the size of foreign fund flows that are expected to enter the country to buy the shares.The huge IPO looks likely to strengthen the case for Saudi Arabia to join the emerging markets indexes of international index compilers such as MSCI, a step which could attract tens of billions of dollars of fresh foreign money to the kingdom.The EFG Hermes survey found 16 percent of respondents expected Saudi Arabia to join MSCI’s emerging markets index next year, 34 percent in 2019, 22 percent in 2020 and 27 percent at a later date.",pos

Samba Capital was earlier named as one of two local advisers.One source said all the banks had now been “onboarded”, a term indicating they had been fully briefed on the IPO process, and had been tasked with work that includes helping ensure systems on the Saudi stock exchange, the Tadawul, can be integrated with a foreign exchange.Saudi Aramco has yet to pick a foreign site to list.When asked for comment, Saudi Aramco said it did not respond to rumour or speculation.

"  Saudi Arabia confirmed on Monday that it planned to sell a stake  of its state oil giant Saudi Aramco which was expected to be  valued at more than $2 trillion.  The sale would be less than 5 percent of the company and would be  via an initial public offering (IPO), Deputy Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman said in a television interview with the Al  Arabiya News Channel.  He also said there were plans for Aramco, or to give it its full  name the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, to be  transformed into a holding company with an elected board,  according to Reuters, with subsidiaries of the firm also to be  sold by IPO.    ""The 5 percent is from the parent company,"" Prince Mohammed told  Al Arabiya in the interview.  ""The kingdom can live in 2020 without any dependence on oil  … The Saudi addiction to oil has disturbed development of  many sectors in past years,"" he added.   ""We plan to set up a $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund... part of  its assets will come from the sale of a small part of Aramco.""  The announcement came as Saudi Arabia's government unveiled a  long-term economic blueprint for life in a low-oil-price world.  Titled ""Saudi Vision 2030,"" the plan includes regulatory, budget  and policy changes that will be implemented over the next 15  years in the hope of making the kingdom less reliant on crude. It  aims to build a ""prosperous and sustainable economic future"" for  the kingdom, according to the press release. It also gave details on privatization and the creation of what it  called the ""largest sovereign wealth fund in the world.""""We hope citizens will work together to achieve Saudi Vision  2030,"" King Salman said in a brief statement, according to the Al  Arabiya broadcaster.  As the world's largest oil exporter, the bulk of Riyadh's state  revenues come from energy exports. But with crude prices  extending their declines — the per-barrel price of global  benchmark Brent is down 60 percent since the rout first started  in June 2014. The country logged a record $98 billion budget  deficit for 2015.   Officials are already taking action to diversify revenue sources  before existing state coffers get depleted. This month, Deputy  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that ownership of the  Aramco and some other national assets would be transferred to a  public fund that invests cash from the country's oil and gas  operations into other sectors.  Aramco does expect the oil supply-demand balance to bring a  recovery in crude prices by the end of 2016.  ""(This is) what we hope for ... by the end of the year, as we  have always said, prices will start adjusting upward because the  current market price is not sustainable for the long term,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told Reuters.  Analysis from McKinsey, before the announcement Monday, suggested  the kingdom could double gross domestic product (GDP) growth from 3.4 percent in  2015 and create as many as six million jobs by 2030 by focusing  on eight non-oil sectors, including manufacturing, mining,  tourism, healthcare and finance. — Reuters and CNBC's Nyshka Chandran contributed to this  article.",neg

"Saudi Arabia has achieved official ""emerging market"" (EM) status in terms of financial markets, but it's not facing the same problems as other EMs, an analyst told CNBC on Tuesday.The country shouldn't dismissed by investors wary of EMs amid rising U.S. interest rates and trade war concerns, Fadi Arbid, founding partner and CIO at Amwal Capital Partners, an independent investment firm in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, said.""We can't isolate ourselves from the emerging market crisis,"" he said. ""Saudi has been one of the best performing markets, but people stopped putting money in EM and Saudi has been tainted with the same brush as all EM — despite Saudi having completely different dynamics or maybe even opposing dynamics thane (other) EM.""A recovery in global oil prices — now around the $80 per barrel mark — is helping Saudi Arabia and its surrounding oil exporters to recover from an economic crisis amid a slump in prices in 2015.""Oil prices are high and that's a blessing for Saudi but a curse for other oil-importing EM. The currency is pegged (to the dollar), that's also not the case with other EM markets that have a crisis, such as Argentina or Turkey, and the third thing is that Saudi is not affected by these trade wars,"" Arbid told CNBC's ""Capital Connection.""""Interest rate hikes do not affect Saudi, whereas it affects all other EM markets which have U.S.-denominated debt and need to print more money, creating more inflation and having to increase interest rates and so on to protect their currencies.""Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil producer in the Middle East and the region's de facto lynchpin. The oil price slump prompted budget deficits to balloon among big-spending governments like Saudi Arabia. Since then, however, it has introduced fiscal reforms to reduce its deficit, such as the introduction of VAT earlier this year and the cutting of costly energy subsidies.The measures might not be popular with the public, but they are part of a larger program of economic and social reforms, known as Vision 2030, being spearheaded by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Saudi Arabia's growth reading for the second quarter is due later Tuesday. It remains to be seen whether the kingdom's economy will continue a recovery seen in the first quarter, when gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted from inflation, grew 1.2 percent from a year earlier. For 2017 as a whole, its GDP shrank 0.7 percent.Saudi's economic recovery has not gone unnoticed. Arbid noted that the Tadawul, Saudi's stock exchange, had seen $3 billion worth of capital inflows since the start of the year, with investors keen to get involved ahead of the country's forthcoming inclusion on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index from June 2019. Inclusion on the index and an official classification as an emerging market is a boon for the  country as it seeks to attract foreign investment.""If you look at the last 12 months, a lot of things have happened in Saudi. We have an MSCI inclusion from a market perspective, we have a lot of social changes, we have the movie industry, cinema industry, we have women driving so I think, taking in all that, the changes we've seen in Saudi over the last 12 months have been immense,"" Arbid said.Financial markets have been roiled in recent months with an escalating trade spat between China and the U.S. seeing mutual tariffs levied on each other's imports. On Tuesday, markets in the Middle East were again trading lower as Sino-U.S. tensions weighed on sentiment. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul All Share Index (TASI) has also had a rocky few months, but is still up 7.5 percent since the start of the year.One of the big questions global investors are focused on when it comes to Saudi Arabia is when, and whether at all, it will take its national oil company, Saudi Aramco, private.The idea to privatize the company came in early 2015, a time when global oil prices had hit a historic low of around $26 a barrel. Now, global oil prices are around $80 a barrel, somewhat disincentivizing the privatization.Speculation and possible dates of an initial public offering (IPO), when the company will be listed on a stock exchange (both in Saudi and abroad), have come and gone, leading many to wonder whether the listing will happen at all.On Monday, Saudi Aramco's CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC he could not say whether the oil giant would make its long-anticipated stock market debut by 2020. Arbid agreed that the possible date of Saudi Aramco's IPO ""does seem to be in limbo,"" but said there are good reasons to delay the launch.""If you look at things that have happened since that announcement (of an IPO)… oil prices today are in the eighties (of dollars per barrel) whereas a few years ago it was almost $30 oil, $25 oil — and now we're in the eighties. So, you have this changing oil price which is extremely important for the Aramco IPO and the longer you wait the better off you are as you'll have anchored $75-$80 oil.""Arbid said Saudi Arabia's recent inclusion on to the MSCI is also a big event for Aramco.

"* Some investors yet to follow up on initial interest - sources* Son plans to go ahead with Vision Fund 2 - sources* Vision 2 Fund likely to miss $108 bln target - sourcesOct 4 (Reuters) - Softbank Group founder and CEO Masayoshi Son is struggling to raise money for a second massive technology investment fund in the wake of the failed public offering of office-rental company WeWork and sliding valuations of other major investments, according to two people familiar with the situation.Son is still determined to go ahead with Vision Fund 2 even though some lieutenants have urged a delay, the two people with knowledge of Softbanks internal discussions told Reuters. But it is likely to be far smaller, at least at the outset, than the $108 billion that Softbank said it had lined up when it announced the fund in July, these people said.Major investors have yet to sign on, leaving a $38 billion pledge from publicly traded Softbank Group itself as the only large commitment, according to the sources. And the size of that pledge may itself be in doubt given some of the recent investment setbacks it has suffered and the lack of available cash on its balance sheet, according to a Reuters analysis.Vision Fund and Softbank Group declined to comment on the progress of Vision Fund 2.The implosion in the valuation of WeWork and questions about its business model have dented Sons reputation as a savvy investor and point to a big writedown by the first Vision Fund. Softbank and the Vision Fund together poured more than $10 billion into the company, investing some of that at a valuation of $47 billion in January. But WeWork recently abandoned plans for an initial public offering that would have pegged the companys worth at just $10-12 billion.If the second fund comes in well short of Sons goal or gets scrapped it will have broad implications for Silicon Valley venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and Wall Street financiers.The first Vision Fund, which raised $97 billion, upended the tech investing world with massive bets on fast-growing but unproven companies. It was bigger than the aggregate amount raised by the entire U.S. venture capital industry in 2018, giving Son a massive influence over the start-up market.Skeptics say the troubles at WeWork and the poor public market performance of money-losing companies such as Uber Technologies Inc and Slack Technologies Inc will trigger a big decline in the value of numerous so-called “unicorn” startups worth more than a billion dollars.“The radiation is spreading everywhere,” said Scott Galloway, an author and one-time entrepreneur who teaches at New York University and who has been closely following the WeWork turmoil.To be sure, there are investments in the 80-plus companies Vision Fund has financed that appear to be paying off quickly. Delivery company DoorDash, for one, has rocketed in value, at least on paper, from $1.4 billion last March to $12.6 billion in May. Softbank, which owns about a third of the Vision Fund, in July reported a 62% return on its investment, including management and performance fees.Son also has a track record of big scores: the $20 million he put into Chinas Alibaba Group Holdings in 2000 is now worth more than $100 billion, for example. Most analysts rate Softbank Group a buy and say it still has borrowing capacity, and its majority-owned telecom and internet media unit throws off healthy profits.DEBT PILES UPBack in July, Softbank said a group of companies, including technology behemoths Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp , as well as a slew of Japanese banks, and Britain’s Standard Chartered Plc would contribute to Vision Fund 2. But it is unclear how firm those commitments are, and none of the corporate investors have a track record of making multi-billion-dollar commitments to an outside venture fund.Microsoft, Apple and Standard Chartered declined to comment.The Japanese institutions are mostly contributing only small amounts, sources familiar with the matter said. At least one financial investor is planning to make loans to the fund rather than contribute cash.Japanese investment bank Nomura Holdings Inc, which was lead underwriter for the IPO of SoftBank’s telecom unit, has decided not to put money into the new fund, according to a source familiar with its plans. Nomura declined to comment.Saudi Arabias Public Investment Fund (PIF), which contributed $45 billion to the first Vision Fund, does not have large amounts of fresh cash to invest until it receives payment from a pending asset sale or proceeds from the planned public offering of the oil firm Aramco, according to people familiar with its finances. The Aramco offering is long delayed and there is no guarantee it will go ahead even next year.The United Arab Emirates’ Mubadala fund still intends to invest in Vision Fund 2 but is seeking more say in the investments, a source familiar with the discussions said.PIF and Mubadala declined to comment.STRAINS ON SOFTBANKThe worsening turmoil at WeWork will continue to be a strain on Softbank and the first fund. The price of WeWork bonds has sunk, its credit ratings have been slashed and big cutbacks are expected at the company, including the possibility of thousands of layoffs. Some real estate investors and analysts say that without further investment from Son or his entities, it will be difficult to stabilize given the size of its future financial commitments.That is just one of the calls on Softbank’s money. Some of the investors in the first Vision Fund receive interest payments of 7% annually on their stakes, an unusual structure that creates an ongoing need for cash. Some of that has come from sale of stakes in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart and publicly traded chipmaker Nvidia Corp, but Softbank has also borrowed money to fund payouts to investors.Softbank also faces the risk that a deal to merge its money-losing U.S. telecom carrier Sprint Corp with T-Mobile US Inc could be blocked by an antitrust lawsuit from U.S. states. If that happens, it will leave Softbank with an expensive liability, analysts say.Softbank’s stock has fallen 13% over the past month and is now trading at its lowest level since January. Softbanks operating cash flow also turned negative last quarter and it could struggle to raise tens of billions of dollars in cash, a Reuters analysis of its balance sheet shows.Softbank does not have significant cash on hand to finance the new fund. As of June 30, it had $27.41 billion of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. However, this and other current assets was more than matched by near-term liabilities.The public offerings in recent months have been a big sore. Since they listed, shares in ride-hailing group Uber are down 34 percent and software company Slacks stock has lost 4 percent, though it is down 41 percent from its high in June. The value of other ride-sharing and self-driving technology companies could also be in question as sentiment in that sector cools.Together with the decline in the value of WeWork, those results are expected to drag down the Vision Fund’s returns, though it is difficult to get a grip on precise numbers. Softbank Group reports overall Vision Fund performance based on a variety of internal valuation metrics, but it does not publicly disclose the numbers on individual companies.Sons financing plans for the second Vision Fund are based on a steady stream of IPOs of existing Vision Fund companies. But with the appetite for IPOs of unprofitable companies waning and concerns about a possible global recession building, the timing isnt the best.I think that its incredibly likely that theyll postpone their plans for  fundraising efforts around Vision Fund 2,” said Andrea Lamari Walne, a Silicon Valley-based partner at Manhattan Venture Partners, which facilitates secondary transactions.(Reporting by Anirban Sen in Bangalore, Sam Nussey and Takashi Umekawain in Tokyo, Tom Bergin in London, Saeed Azhar in Dubai, Stanley Carvalho in Abu Dhabi, Jane Lanhee Lee in San Francisco and Timothy McLaughlin in Boston; Writing by Jonathan Weber; Editing by Martin Howell and Edward Tobin)",pos

"  The oil slide is not over yet — we still have a few dollars  to go, Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities at Bank  of America Merrill Lynch, told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” on  Friday.   “We are still in the middle of a major Chinese yuan depreciation  wave, we still have to get the Iranian barrels ... we also have  refinery maintenance ahead of us, which means inventories for  crude oil are going to build,” said the expert, noting that this  is just the natural pace of the market. The market cycle isn’t the only thing that worries investors. Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil company on Friday confirmed  that it has been considering options to allow public  participation on its equity.   Don’t panic, Blanch said, because in a scenario where shares of Saudi Aramco begin to float  into the market, there won’t be any price implications for oil  right away.  However, Blanch believes there are other areas that may be affected.   “It may have implications for the forward price; it definitely  may have implications for the Saudi currency,” he  said. While some market watchers consider an initial public offering a desperate money-raising move from the Saudis, Blanch considers an IPO of Aramco to be a “strange idea at a strange time.”“The Saudi Arabia monetary authority still has over $600 billion in foreign exchange reserves at their central bank,” he said. “Saudi Arabia has a lot of money, they don’t need to raise capital right now.” Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the size of Saudi Arabia’s foreign exchange reserves.

"Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund is planning to tap the debt market twice this year, after an overwhelmingly positive response from international investors.The Public Investment Fund (PIF) is seeking to raise debt over the coming months as part of a sustained effort to boost its firepower and help support the oil-rich kingdom’s ambitious economic transformation plans.“We asked for $8 billion syndicate loan and we got an amazing response from the markets. We got like $24 (billion)… That was sometime last year. This year, we will do at least two debt raises,” Yasir Bin Othman Al-Rumayyan, managing director of Saudi Arabia’s PIF, told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles on Tuesday.When asked how much he was expecting the fund to raise over the coming months, Al-Rumayyan said: “I think it’s going to be in the neighborhood of like 14 billion Saudi riyal and for the U.S. dollar I think it’s going to be north of $8 or $10 billion.”“And still, I mean, this doesn’t represent even 5% of our AUM (assets under management). Our target is to go between 15% to 20%. So, we’ll continue on raising debt,” he added.Last month, Saudi Arabia’s state-controlled energy giant Aramco received more than $100 billion in orders by April 9 for its debut bond sale — even after a prospectus said Riyadh would not guarantee Aramco’s notes — but chose to sell only $12 billion.The first-ever debt issuance from Aramco sparked massive global interest, with the move offering investors greater visibility into the financial performance of the world’s most profitable company.Many saw the debt deal as a relationship-building exercise ahead of plans to list a portion of Aramco on international stock markets in about two years.That’s largely because Aramco’s bond sale took place about six months after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate of Istanbul. Intelligence agencies in the U.S. have since concluded the Saudi crown prince ordered the killing of Khashoggi.Riyadh denies that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the murder.Khashoggi’s killing sparked concerns that international investors would shun the kingdom, but bond buyers do not appear ready to overlook an investment opportunity in Saudi Arabia — the world’s largest oil exporter.Aramco’s debut bond sale came shortly after Aramco’s planned $69.1 billion acquisition of a 70% stake in petrochemicals firm Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund.Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, PIF’s Al-Rumayyan said the planned listing date of Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO) in 2021 could yet be brought forward.But, this could not happen before Aramco completed its bid for a majority stake in SABIC, he added.“Once this transaction is closed I think there shouldn’t be any reason for us to put Aramco IPO in a delay,” Al-Rumayyan said.— Reuters contributed to this report.— Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the correct title of Yasir Bin Othman Al-Rumayyan.",pos
"(Adds quotes, background)RIYADH, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s economic growth in 2019 will be significantly less than the kingdom had expected because of OPEC-led oil output cuts, but the attack on Aramco had “zero” impact on revenue, the country’s finance minister said on Wednesday.“Total GDP is going to be significantly less than what we have forecasted,” Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters in an interview in Riyadh, referring to internal estimates.Jadaan said the oil-driven GDP is influenced by Saudi Arabia’s lower petroleum output in the wake of an OPEC-led supply deal to support oil markets.He did not give any projections for 2019 GDP growth in the Arab world’s largest economy, but the International Monetary Fund has said it could grow 1.9% in 2019, slower than 2.2% in 2018.The Saudi central bank had said earlier this year the economy will grow no less than 2% in 2019.Economists have said the kingdom may have to revise down economic growth estimates due to lower crude output, with some forecasting a contraction this year in the world’s biggest oil exporter.Oil prices surged earlier this week after an attack on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities on Saturday knocked out more than 5% of global oil supply, but prices began to ease on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said it would restore production lost by the end of the month.WITHOUT INTERRUPTIONJadaan said Aramco continues to supply oil to the markets without interruption, which meant there is no interruption to oil revenue.“Our focus is on non-oil GDP, that’s where diversification is,” he said, saying non-oil GDP is expected to grow at 2.9% in 2019.He said royalties and taxes are expected to be same from Aramco this year.Jadaan also said Saudi Arabia is likely to issue dollar-denominated sukuk, depending on market conditions.He said the Aramco IPO is moving ahead as planned and will most likely happen over the next 12 months.Aramco’s primary listing will be on Tadawul in Riyadh, but the government is still considering a secondary listing overseas, he said.

"minister@ (Adds quotes, details, Aramco CEO comments)JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will restore its lost oil output of 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of September and has managed to recover oil supplies to the levels they were at prior to weekend attacks on its facilities by drawing from oil inventories.Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said oil production in October would be 9.89 million bpd and that the world’s top oil exporter would ensure full oil supplies to customers this month.He said the kingdom would achieve 11 million bpd capacity by end of September and 12 million bpd by end of November.“Oil supplies will be returned to the market as they were before 3:43 am Saturday,” he told a news conference in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, saying state oil giant Aramco had emerged “like a phoenix from the ashes” after the attack.He was referring to attacks on Saturday on Saudi Aramco plants in Abqaiq and Khurais, including the world’s largest oil processing facility, which shut down half of Saudi Arabia’s production, or 5% of global output.Aramco chief executive Amin Nasser said the company, which is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO), was still in the process of estimating repair work but that it was “not that significant,” given the company’s size.Aramco had put out 10 fires in the span of seven hours after the “huge” assault, Nasser told the same news conference.He said the company was in the process of bringing back oil refining to full capacity and that there were enough crude products to supply the local markets.Prince Abdulaziz said Riyadh did not yet know who carried out the strikes or why, adding Saudi Arabia would keep its role as a secure supplier of global markets. He said stricter measures needed to be taken to prevent further attacks, but did not elaborate.The foreign ministry has said that preliminary investigations indicated Iranian weapons were used in the assault, which authorities initially said involved drones.

""In some ways, I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal.""The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, are discussing a plan to increase an existing supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) by a further 400,000 bpd and extend the pact until June, two sources familiar with the matter said.Saudi Arabia is pushing the plan to deliver a positive surprise to the market before the initial public offering of state-owned Saudi Aramco, the sources said.At the same time, a senior official at the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday that OPEC producers are unlikely to agree to change their current deal on curbing output until the market outlook becomes clearer.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Tuesday said he expected this week's meeting to be constructive but added that Moscow had yet to finalize its position.Vagit Alekperov, CEO of Russia's second-biggest oil producer, Lukoil, said it would not be expedient to deepen production cuts in the winter, especially for Russia.JPMorgan said in a note on Tuesday that it expects OPEC+ to agree to deepen the production cut to 1.5 million bpd until the end of 2020.OPEC ministers meet in Vienna on Thursday and the broader OPEC+ group gathers on Friday.While OPEC may cut output, U.S. producers have been happy to meet any market shortfalls with record-setting output. Growth into 2020 could range between 100,000 bpd and 1 million bpd.U.S. crude oil inventories likely declined by 1.8 million barrels last week, according to six analysts polled by Reuters. Industry data is expected to be released at 4:30 p.m. EST (2130 GMT) on Tuesday, while government data is due on Wednesday.""Ongoing concerns over the global economy and the U.S.-China trade war continue to weigh on prices but U.S. crude inventories are expected to have declined last week which may lend some support,"" Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said in a note.",neg
"Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange, the Tadawul, took its first step Monday of inclusion in two major international indexes: the FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones’ emerging markets indices.The inclusion marks a continuation of efforts by the Saudi kingdom to open up its market to international investors, Tadawul CEO Khalid Abdullah al-Hussan told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble in Riyadh.“We haven’t seen any turbulence on inflows of cash for the first tranche of FTSE and it was very smooth by both the sellers and as well as the buyers, which in my opinion confirmed the confidence of international investors to participate in the Saudi markets and the regulatory framework of the Saudi capital market,” al-Hussan said.Al-Hussan expects this inclusion to bring in around $15 billion in passive inflows across the indices, adding that calculating the expected active funds is more challenging.Inclusion in the FTSE Russell Emerging Markets index will take place in five tranches over the next 12 months, while that of the S&P Dow Jones Emerging Markets indices will be completed with a second phase in September of this year. Monday’s initial tranche of 25 percent “will be split over March 2019 and April 2019 (10% and 15% respectively) to ensure a smooth transition,” according to a Tadawul press release.Capital markets reforms and economic liberalization have been core tenets of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which aims to spur greater foreign investment to diversify its economy away from its reliance on hydrocarbon revenues and grow private-sector jobs.Al-Hussan commented on the long-awaited public offering of Saudi state oil giant Aramco, emphasizing the importance of timing and effective due diligence.The commitment to go public, he said, requires “doing all of the analysis and the due diligence works to be ready to go public. I think this is the most important decision. The timing is what works well for the market as well as the issuers... Every single issuer is always concerned about what is the right time.”The Aramco IPO, which has been delayed since 2018, would be the largest public offering in history if listed. Saudi officials now say the listing will go ahead in 2021.“I would refer that to our own IPO — we’re always looking at this very strategically,” the CEO continued. “What is the right time to go public for the company, the market the investors the current shareholders all of these are factors to be considered.”The Tadawul was roughly flat on Monday at 1:00 p.m. in Riyadh, and is up 9.4 percent since the start of this year.",pos
"DUBAI ⁠— Saudi Arabia’s stock market fell by 2.3% at Sunday’s open as the country grappled with weekend drone attacks on the heart of its oil production facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais claimed by Yemen’s Houthi rebels.Reports that the country may take weeks to return to full oil supply capacity is set to send crude futures up by as much as $10 per barrel, analysts say, depending on the scale of the damage. Half the country’s oil production was halted due to fire damage and an assessment of the situation is due on Monday, Saudi energy ministry officials said. They have not yet offered a timeline on full production restoration.“A small $2-$3 premium would emerge if the damage appears to be an issue that can be resolved quickly, and $10 if the damage to Aramco’s facilities is significant leading to prolonged supply outages,” Ayham Kamel, practice head for the Middle East and North Africa at Eurasia group, said in a research note Sunday. That’s up to 25 cents higher per gallon of gasoline.Abqaiq, in the kingdom’s eastern province, is the world’s largest oil processing facility and crude oil stabilization plant with a processing capacity of more than 7 million barrels per day (bpd). Khurais is the second largest oil field in the country with a capacity to pump around 1.5 million bpd.Saturday’s attack is the biggest on Saudi oil infrastructure since Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, when the Iraqi military fired scud missiles into the kingdom.“Oil prices will surely spike on the news of the attacks when markets open on Sunday,” Joseph McMonigle, an energy analyst at Hedgeye Research and former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Energy, wrote in a client note. “In our view, there is almost no geopolitical risk priced into oil markets that are focused solely on the macro and trade narratives.”If the Saudis maintain closure of half its production, it would impact nearly 5 million barrels of crude production a day, roughly 5% of the world’s daily oil production. In August, Saudi Arabia produced 9.85 million bpd, according to the latest figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Saudi Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser said no one was hurt in the attacks and emergency crews have contained the fires and brought the situation under control.What Riyadh has called a terrorist attack on its state oil giant, Saudi Aramco, is also likely to unsettle future shareholders and market participants ahead of the company’s highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO).“Very hard to overstate the seriousness of the attacks, especially on Abqaiq. It is the nerve center of the country’s energy infrastructure,” Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC on Saturday. “Even if exports resume in the next 24 to 48 hours, the image of invulnerability has been erased.”While Yemen’s Houthi rebels, who have been at war with the Saudis since 2015, claimed the attack, numerous officials and analysts point to Tehran. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo via Twitter blamed Iran for the attack, saying “Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply. There is no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.”Iran responded by calling the allegations “pointless.”Security experts say the attack likely came from an Iranian-backed militant group in Iraq. Baghdad on Sunday afternoon denied its territory was involved in any way.The Houthis have been behind numerous attacks on Saudi infrastructure in recent years, but they were not viewed as serious by the market, McMonigle said. This time, the attacks ⁠— regardless of their source ⁠— are impossible to ignore.⁠—CNBC’s Yun Li contributed to this report.",neg

"* Kuwait committed to implement lower output deal -oil minister* Global economic outlook darkens amid trade war - Ifo* IEA says oil demand hurt by trade war, slowing economy (Updates prices, adds commentary)HOUSTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Monday as expectations that major producers would continue to reduce global supplies faced worries about sluggish crude demand growth due to the U.S.-China trade war.International benchmark Brent crude was 6 cents higher at $58.59 a barrel by 11:51 a.m. CDT (1651 GMT), after trading between $57.88 and $58.88.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose 26 cents to $54.76 per barrel, after trading in a range of $53.54 to $55.18.Investors were torn between forecasts of slowing global oil demand growth and chatter about renewed efforts by major producers to curtail output and support prices, analysts said.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, have agreed to cut 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since Jan. 1.Kuwait was “fully committed” to the OPEC+ agreement, Oil Minister Khaled al-Fadhel said, adding the OPEC member has cut its own output by more than required by the accord.He also said fears of a global economic downturn, which have weighed down on prices, were “exaggerated,” and global demand for crude should pick up in the second half, helping reduce the surplus in oil inventories gradually.Analysts said that in a sign that de-facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia intends to support prices, state-run Saudi Aramco is ready to launch what could be the world’s largest initial public offering (IPO).The Saudi government will decide when it will take place based on its perception of “what would be the optimum market condition,” senior Aramco executive Khalid al-Dabbagh said in an analyst call.The official said Saudi Aramco has also signed a letter of intent with India’s Reliance to potentially buy a stake in its refining and petrochemicals business.“The Saudis will need a higher price for oil for its IPO, and this confirms they’ll do whatever it takes to get oil prices up,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.Analysts said more reductions were needed to support prices as forecasters and government agencies issue gloomy predictions for the global economy and oil demand growth.The economic outlook has deteriorated worldwide as the trade dispute between the United States and China escalates, a survey by Germany’s Ifo economic institute said in its quarterly survey of nearly 1,200 experts in more than 110 countries.“It’s going to take the market far longer to come back into balance, which has forced OPEC and non-OPEC producers to continue with their production cuts,” said Andy Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston.The International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Friday mounting signs of an economic slowdown had caused global oil demand to grow at its slowest pace since the financial crisis of 2008.A weakening dollar also propped up oil prices as investors feared the trade war would slow U.S. economic growth, analysts said. A softer greenback makes dollar-denominated crude cheaper for foreign buyers.On Friday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said hedge funds raised their net long positions in U.S. crude futures and options in the week to Aug. 6. It was a signal some investors are “trying to pick the bottom,” said Robert Yawger, an analyst at Mizuho in New York.“They took the opportunity to get in,” Yawger said. “The spec(ulator) community appears to want to trade these lows.”(Additional reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin, Jane Chung Editing by Marguerita Choy and Kirsten Donovan)",pos
"Saudi Aramco is considering to sell shares privately rather than list them publicly, the Financial Times reported Friday, citing five sources familiar with the matter.Talks between the Saudi state oil giant and the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors have picked up in the last few weeks, the sources told the newspaper. A Saudi Aramco spokesperson told CNBC that “a range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track.”The world’s major financial centers have vied to host Saudi Aramco’s public stock offering, which could raise an estimated $100 billion.Even if Saudi Aramco decided to sell shares privately, the company would still plan to list shares on the kingdom’s Tadawul exchange next year, the FT said, citing sources. An international listing could also follow, although likely not until 2019 or later, the newspaper said.The Chinese government is close to playing a key role in any new plan for offering shares, the FT report said, citing a person working for Saudi Aramco.Read the full Financial Times story here.",pos
"The much-anticipated international listing of Saudi Aramco — the world’s largest oil company — is likely to be delayed until 2019, but that decision makes sense given that oil prices are expected to head to $80 per barrel, a private equity investor said.The state-owned oil firm is expected to list on the Saudi stock exchange in the second half of this year, but an international listing — which was at one point tipped to happen at the same time — is said to have been temporarily shelved.“Timing is of the essence,” Fadi Arbid, founding partner and chief investment officer at Amwal Capital Partners, told CNBC’s “Capital Connection” on Tuesday.“For a company, for which underlying commodity is oil, it would make a lot of sense to wait for that rally. And if you believe that rally is expected to continue, I think you may as well wait,” he added.Oil prices in recent weeks rose on concerns that sanctions by the U.S. on Iran would squeeze supply further. During Asian trading hours on Tuesday, both Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude futures touched their highest since November 2014.There are still questions in the investing community about which international exchange Saudi Aramco would list on, with exchanges in New York, London and even those in China in the running for a slice of the public share offering.The company’s choice is a “strategic, tactical and maybe political” one, said Arbid. But what’s more important is how Saudi Arabia uses the proceeds to support efforts to diversify its economy away from its reliance on oil.The oil market suffered one of its biggest losses two years ago after an increase in U.S. shale production caused prices to plunge below $30 per barrel. Saudi Arabia, a major oil-producing country, subsequently accelerated plans to grow other parts of its economy.Those efforts have started to pay off, said Arbid, who noted that around 39 percent of the country’s revenue last year came from non-oil sectors. That’s about 10 percent more than the year before, he said.“Saudi is indeed moving away from a hydrocarbon economy to a more efficient, productive economy where employment is the main driver,” Arbid said.",pos
"A portion of Saudi Aramco may not go public until late next year. But when it does, it could stunt price growth in crude oil, Dennis Gartman said Monday.  Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC on Sunday his plan to take part of the world’s largest oil company public remains on track for the second half of 2018. Recent reports have suggested the offering may be delayed into 2019 or even shelved. When a portion of it does go public, it’s going to be “very difficult” for U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to break $55 a barrel and “tough” to push Brent crude past $60 per barrel, Gartman told CNBC’s “Fast Money.” On Monday, WTI traded at $51.90 and Brent crude traded at $57.33. “So I think yes, the IPO when it comes — it is a long way away, it’s the next half of next year — but I think that probably shall mark a very important high for the crude oil market for many years into the future,” said Gartman, editor and publisher of The Gartman Letter. If Gartman was forced to invest in oil, he would choose refiners rather than the producers. “If you have to have something in the oil business, if you want to own oil in some manner, own the refiners,” he said. “I think that’s a better trade.”",neg
"* NEWSMAKER profile of Prince Abdulaziz:* New Saudi min: pillars of Saudi policy do not change* Interactive graphic on U.S. rig count: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XdttIW (Updates prices, adds analyst)LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday after the new Saudi energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, confirmed expectations that there would be no radical change in his country’s oil policy.Prince Abdulaziz, son of Saudi King Salman and a long-time member of the Saudi delegation to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, replaced Khalid al-Falih on Sunday.Global benchmark Brent crude futures were up 69 cents at $62.23 a barrel by 1343 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate gained 95 cents to $57.47.Speaking on Monday, Prince Abdulaziz said the pillars of Saudi Arabia’s policy would not change and that a global deal to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day would survive.He added that the so-called OPEC+ alliance between OPEC and non-member countries including Russia, a partnership he helped cement, was staying for the long term. He declined to comment on oil prices.Russia’s oil output in August exceeded its quota under the OPEC+ agreements.OPEC oil output in August rose for the first month this year as higher supply from Iraq and Nigeria outweighed restraint by Saudi Arabia and losses caused by U.S. sanctions on Iran.Abdulaziz also said the kingdom’s aim was for an Initial Public Offering of Saudi Aramco to happen “as soon as possible”.“I expect no deviation from Saudi policy. If anything, maybe more of a push in the direction of getting inventories down and getting the market into shape for the (Aramco) IPO,” said Robert Ryan, Chief Energy Strategist at BCA research.The United Arab Emirates’ energy minister, Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazroui, said on Sunday that OPEC and non-OPEC producers were “committed” to achieving oil market balance.The OPEC+ deal’s joint ministerial monitoring committee meets on Thursday in Abu Dhabi.Trade and geopolitical tensions are affecting the market, Mazrouei said, but he was quick to rule out hasty steps influenced by the trade war between the United States and China.“The fear of slower (oil) demand is only going to happen if that tension is escalating and I am personally hopeful that is not the case,” Mazrouei told Reuters.Prices on Monday were also supported by a rise in oil imports in China in August, with shipments to the world’s biggest importer up 3% from July and nearly 10% higher in the first eight months of 2019 from a year earlier.S&P Global Platts said it would launch new price assessments for U.S. crude for Asian buyers from Oct. 1, as the United States exports more oil to the East.In the United States, drilling companies cut the number of operating oil rigs for a third week.(Additional reporting by Aaron Sheldrick in TOKYO; Editing by Dale Hudson/Mark Heinrich)",pos

The tariffs had been scheduled to start next month.“The U.S.-China trade war has caused energy demand growth to take a big hit. Any glimmer of hope revives the prospects for a more positive demand landscape,” said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital Management in New York.Brent futures rose $2.73, or 4.7%, to settle at $61.30 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained $2.17, or 4.0%, to settle at $57.10.That was the biggest daily percentage gain for Brent since December when the contract gained 3/8 7.9%.Oil prices pared some of their gains in post-settlement trade after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed U.S. crude stocks unexpectedly rose last week.Crude inventories climbed 3.7 million barrels to 443 million, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 2.8 million barrels, the API said.U.S. government data on crude stocks is due on Wednesday morning.Since falling to their lowest levels since January on Aug. 7, Brent has gained 9% and WTI 12%. That bigger gain in WTI over the past four days briefly cut Brent’s premium over WTI <WTCLc1-LCOc1> to its lowest since March 2018.The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on Tuesday that U.S. and Chinese trade officials spoke on the phone and agreed to talk again within two weeks.“The possibility that the United States and China can get the trade talks on track ... is raising hopes that they might actually get some type of deal,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.“That’s why we are seeing this big rebound in prices,” Flynn said.Before the U.S. announcement about the tariff delay, Brent futures were still trading about 20% below the 2019 high they hit in April.In addition to the cooling of the U.S.-China trade war, analysts said prices were propped up by expectations U.S. crude inventories declined last week and a belief Saudi Arabia will stick with production cuts.In the United States, analysts forecasts crude stockpiles fell by 2.8 million barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll.“If we get the drawdown in (U.S.) inventory that most people are looking for, that is going to get the market a lot tighter,” said Flynn at Price Futures.Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), last week said it planned to keep its crude exports below 7 million barrels per day (bpd) in August and September to help drain global oil inventories. OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, have agreed to cut 1.2 million bpd of production since Jan. 1.The kingdom’s plan to float its national oil company Saudi Aramco in what could be the world’s largest initial public offering (IPO) gives it further impetus to boost prices.“Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies standing firm on their commitment to the OPEC+ output-cut agreement has supported prices,” said Abhishek Kumar, head of analytics at Interfax Energy in London.(Additional reporting by Ron Bousso in London, Roslan Khasawneh in Singapore and Laila Kearney in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Goodman)",neg
"(Adds Russian agri ministry statement after 3rd paragraph)MOSCOW, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Russian Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev and Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih will discuss the development of bilateral relations, including agricultural trade, during their meeting on Thursday, the Russian ministry said.In August, Saudi Arabia decided to relax its bug-damage specifications for wheat imports, opening the door to Black Sea imports and strengthening ties with Russia beyond energy cooperation.Falih and Patrushev will meet as part of Patrushev’s visit to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, the ministry added. Patrushev will also meet his Saudi Arabian counterpart, Abdulrahman al-Fadhli, and visit one of Saudi Arabia’s agriculture companies.In a separate statement on Wednesday evening, the Russian ministry said Patrushev had proposed boosting exports of agriculture products to Saudi Arabia. The trade of such products between the two countries totalled $500 million in 2018.“We propose developing a joint programme for expansion of exports of Russian food products to Saudi Arabia so that exports of Russian agriculture products exceed $2 billion by 2024,” Patrushev was quoted as saying in the statement.He said Russian producers of poultry, honey, milk, flour and confectionary were interested in boosting supplies to Saudi Arabia.The ministry is also ready to support Saudi companies willing to take part in agriculture products projects in Russia, he said.Russia, the world’s largest wheat exporter, has long sought access to Saudi Arabia’s wheat market as Moscow tries to take further market share in Middle Eastern and North African wheat markets from the European Union and the United States.After Saudi Arabia said in August it would relax its limits for bug-damage in hard wheat to 0.5% from 0% from its next tender, a Russian industry source told Reuters that Moscow would continue to press Saudi Arabia to reduce the bug damage level to 1%.The change in these specifications has had wider implications as Riyadh - which regards the United States as its most important ally - moves closer to Moscow, with Russian President Vladimir Putin due to visit Saudi Arabia in October.A delegation from Russia which includes major Russian grain, meat and dairy companies has also arrived with Patrushev to Saudi Arabia, the Russian ministry said.

"Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange, the Tadawul, has officially completed its full inclusion on the MSCI emerging markets index.The second and final phase of its inclusion marks a continuation of efforts by the oil-rich kingdom to open up its financial market to international investors.“Summer is over today, we have started with the MSCI inclusion and … we believe liquidity should be enhanced by opening this new channel of foreign investors,” Tadawul CEO Khalid Abdullah al-Hussan told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble in an exclusive interview.Saudi Arabia’s stock market — the largest in the region, worth approximately $549 billion — will have a weight of 2.8% on the MSCI index.The inclusion will also help when it comes to initial public offerings (IPO), al-Hussan said, before adding that the participation of foreign investors in the Saudi market would result in “flawless” public listings.His comments come as investors eagerly await the listing of state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco — which is likely to become the largest publicly-traded company in the world.The Tadawul closed more than 1% lower on Wednesday, but remains up roughly 4.4% since the start of the year.In a report published earlier this week, analysts at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said early positioning by investors had been “relatively slow” since the MSCI inclusion announcement last year.That’s because market participants were worried about policy uncertainty, high valuations for Saudi-listed firms and reputational damage related to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.“Nonetheless, it seems that investors have shrugged off such concerns this year,” analysts at the IIF said.The IIF’s report found that in the first eight months of 2019, foreign equity inflows to Saudi Arabia surpassed those of India and China — “which was remarkable given that Saudi Arabia’s economy is just a fraction of the size of India and China.”Strong inflows to Saudi Arabia this year are in sharp contrast to other emerging markets, the IIF report said, citing renewed U.S.-China trade tensions for weaker equity flows in other emerging markets.Saudi Arabia’s main stock market index joined the FTSE earlier this year and hopes to be included in the S&P by the end of this year.Index provider MSCI incorporated shares of companies based in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar into its emerging market index in 2014.—Clarification: This story has been updated with the latest figure from Tadawul on its total value.",pos
"OPEC has urged its members not to mention oil prices when discussing policy in a break from the past, as the oil producing group seeks to avoid the risk of U.S. legal action for manipulating the market, sources close to OPEC said.Proposed U.S. legislation known as “NOPEC,” which could open the group up to antitrust lawsuits, has long lain dormant, with previous American presidents signaling that they would veto any move to make it law.But U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, blaming it for high oil prices and urging it to increase output to relieve pressure on a market hovering around four-year highs.That has made OPEC and its unofficial leader, Saudi Arabia, nervous about what it might mean for NOPEC, or No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act.The decision to refrain from discussing a preferred oil price level — one way the group can guide market expectations — underlines how Trump’s aggressive stance on the oil market is unsettling OPEC and testing ties between allies Riyadh and Washington.In July, senior OPEC officials attended a workshop in Vienna with international law firm White & Case to discuss the NOPEC bill, and the lawyers advised avoiding public discussion of oil prices and rather talk about the stability of the oil market, two sources familiar with the matter said.OPEC officials were also advised to explore diplomatic lobbying channels to try and prevent the NOPEC bill from becoming law, one of the sources said.On Aug. 1, the OPEC secretariat sent a letter to the ministers making a similar recommendation.“We solemnly believe that market stability, and not prices, is the common objective of our actions,” UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazroui, who holds the rotating OPEC presidency this year, wrote in the letter, seen by Reuters.“I would like to call upon OPEC Member Countries, as well as our participating Non-OPEC colleagues, to refrain from any reference to prices in their commentary about our collective efforts or oil market condition,” he added.White & Case did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.Specifying oil prices is not the only way OPEC tries to guide the market. By cutting production it can support prices and by raising supplies it can do the opposite, for example.But the private coordination of how to communicate OPEC’s message to the market represents a departure from past practice, when Saudi Arabia would often signal a preferred price level when speaking about OPEC policy and seek to push through actions to achieve that.While chances of the law passing this year appear slim, concerns among OPEC members and other oil producers are growing that it may ultimately get the support of Trump, given his open criticism of OPEC and high oil prices.The OPEC letter came two months before U.S.-Saudi relations were further strained when a Saudi journalist disappeared during a visit to the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul.Turkish officials say they believe Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi policies, was murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has strongly denied killing Khashoggi.Some members of the U.S. Congress, which has long had a testy relationship with Saudi Arabia, have criticized the kingdom over the case.A Senate source familiar with the bill said renewed interest in NOPEC was likely, as lawmakers weigh any actions in response to Khashoggi’s disappearance.The source, who declined to be named, said that with lawmakers out of town for the next several weeks, it was difficult to measure current sentiment.Over much of the last year, Saudi Arabia irked Washington by pushing OPEC to adopt measures to boost oil prices in a shift from its previous, more moderate stance.Industry sources have linked that shift to a desire to maximize revenues and raise the valuation of state energy giant Saudi Aramco ahead of a planned IPO, a key part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s reforms aimed at diversifying the economy.The share float, expected by some to be worth up to $100 billion, has been put on hold, sources have told Reuters.Prince Mohammed said this month the float was postponed to 2021, and several industry sources say the delay was partly because of litigation risks if Aramco was listed in New York, a preferred venue by the Saudi crown prince.“There is a major fear NOPEC could turn into another JASTA,” one of the sources familiar with Aramco IPO preparations said, referring to the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act which allows victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Riyadh.Saudi Arabia, which denies involvement in the attacks, had long had broad immunity from the lawsuits. That changed in 2016, when the U.S. Congress overrode then-President Barack Obama’s veto of JASTA.With close to $1 trillion in investments in the United States, including assets owned by Aramco, Riyadh has a lot to lose if the NOPEC bill was passed into law.It would revoke the sovereign immunity which oil producers, including OPEC members, currently enjoy from U.S. legal action.Washington-based legal firm Gibson Dunn and the Saudi embassy there signed a contract in late August, according to a copy of the contract filed to the U.S. Department of Justice.The contract outlines that among its other responsibilities, Gibson Dunn would be “opposing NOPEC.”Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has also raised concerns over NOPEC with senior U.S. officials including U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry during private meetings, two sources familiar with the talks told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.",pos
"* Hong Kong protests, Argentine peso collapse unsettle markets* Europe ensures world shares stay down for third straight day Sentiment already weak due to U.S.-China trade war* Risk-off trades support safe-haven assetsLONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Share markets fell for a third straight day on Tuesday as fears about a drawnout global trade war, protests in Hong Kong and a crash in Argentina’s peso currency kept investors huddled in bonds, gold, and the Japanese yen for safety.If that wasn’t enough, Europe’s bourses and the euro were given an additional shove lower by an alarming German sentiment survey after some heavy falls in China, Hong Kong, Japan had also whacked down Asia overnight.MSCI’s main 47-country world index has dropped nearly 4% this month already and with Wall Street futures pointing to a 0.2% start in the red for New York, those hoping for a rebound were left tallying up the worries.Hong Kong’s airport, the world’s busiest cargo hub, had been forced to suspend check-ins again as the mood remained febrile after weeks of increasingly violent demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled territory.Investors were also still assessing the damage caused by Monday’s crash in Argentina after its President Mauricio Macri became the latest pro-free market, pro-reform leader to be given a beating at the polls by a populist rival.Battered local markets were struggling to decide which way to go. Government bond price and bank stocks were showing tentative signs of stabilisation, but nothing compared to what was lost in Monday’s mauling.The peso dropped 15%, equities had crumbled 48% in dollar terms - the second-biggest one-day slump anywhere since 1950 - while a 100-year bond that investors had gobbled up recently tumbling 20% as fears of yet another default spiked.“Yes, Argentina is a small economy. However, the last thing global markets want to see is another market-friendly government fall to populism and/or geopolitics,” said Rabobank strategist Michael Every.He added the “wall of worry” also now includes: the trade war, Brexit, China, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Kashmir, North Korea, South China Sea, Turkey, and Venezuela. “Did I miss anything with tired eyes?”With so much uncertainty around, Europe’s traditional safety play, the 10-year German government bond, saw yields hit a new record low of -0.6%The dismal data had driven that too showing that economic sentiment among German investors had slumped far more than expected last month and to the lowest level since the euro debt crisis was ratcheting up in late 2011.Equivalent U.S. Treasury yields were straining for their lowest in almost three years too, gold climbed to a fresh six-year high and the yen stayed within a whisker of a seven-month peak versus the dollar.ING analysts said the yen was benefiting “from the best of both worlds”, pointing to general risk aversion and a rush to price in more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. They think the yen, at 105.10 in Europe, will rally to 102 or 103 per dollar later this year.The Swiss franc, also viewed as a safe haven, rose 0.1% to a two-year high against the euro of 1.0862 francs though that was largely down to another dip from the euro as it backpedalled to $1.1204 against the dollar.PANIC AND CHAOSWhile there was a danger the moves were be being exaggerated by low northern hemisphere summer trading volumes, there was no shortage of gloomy news for investors looking to catch their breath from several months of market ructions.The weeks-long protests in Hong Kong began in opposition to a bill allowing extraditions to mainland China but have quickly morphed into the biggest challenge to China’s authority over the city since it took Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997.A state of “panic and chaos” now exists, the city’s embattled leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday, defying fresh calls to quit.As she spoke, the benchmark Hang Seng index hit a seven-month low. By the close, it had dropped 2.1%, dragging down markets across Asia and taking its losses since the protests began in June past 6%.MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares skidded 1.2% as Chinese stocks and the Nikkei in Tokyo both fell around 1% too though at least the yuan remained quiet.The dive for safety pushed gold up another 0.5% to $1.523 per ounce and its latest six-year high.Oil prices meanwhile held their ground as expectations that major producers will continue to reduce supplies balanced out worries about sluggish economic growth.Brent crude inched up to $58.74 while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were flat at $54.81 a barrel.It comes too with Saudi Arabia repushing plans to float its national oil company Saudi Aramco in what could be the world’s largest initial public offering (IPO).“With Saudi Aramco reportedly eyeing an IPO once again, there is some support to the idea that Saudi Arabia has a heightened interest in strong crude prices and will cut its own output accordingly,” Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said.(Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Hugh Lawson)",pos
"A turning point in the oil market is on the horizon amid a sharp drop in investments and a lack of fresh conventional discoveries, Saudi Aramco’s chief executive told CNBC on Monday.“A lack of investment is definitely not helping, so if that continues over the next couple of years there will be an inflection point,” Amin Nasser said on the sidelines of the World Petroleum Congress in Istanbul.Oil market watchers are constantly fretting over the balancing of supply and demand. Many have focused on the supply dynamics since oil’s drop in mid-2014, as U.S. shale has compounded a global glut of the commodity. But, Nasser believes this could change in the coming years and people could start worrying about whether there is enough oil to meet demand.About $1 trillion in investments have already been lost since a decline in oil prices from 2014, Nasser said in a speech early on Monday. He explained that while unconventional oil and gas investments had been positive for the industry, they alone would not be sufficient over the long term to meet needed demand.Earlier in the day, the CEO of Saudi Aramco - the state-owned oil company of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - told a conference that 20 million barrels per day of new production would be required in order to meet demand growth and offset a national decline of developed fields. Since the start of 2017, oil prices have slipped over 17 percent to less than $50 a barrel.When asked whether Saudi Aramco could be poised to delay its initial public offering (IPO) given investor concerns over both its price and timing, Nasser stressed the company’s investment plans would be “geared towards the long term.“He added the state oil giant remained on track to sell around 5 percent of its business in an initial public offering next year.",pos
"– This is the script of CNBC’s news report for China’s CCTV on June 22, Thursday.Welcome to CNBC Business Daily, I’m Qian Chen.Oil prices were slightly higher on Wednesday, before tumbling to a 10-month low during the trading session.According to Vanada Hari, founder of Singapore-based energy consulting firm Vanda Insights, the bearishness has been spread from panic correction to a so-called “paranoia” selloff.Therefore, some positive data barely helped to support oil prices overnight.The U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude inventories declined by 2.45 million barrels in the latest week, marking the 9th weekl decline in 11 weeks and exceeding expectations for a 2.1 million-barrel drop.Meanwhile, Cushing inventories recorded a further draw of 1.08 million barrels on the week to 61.1 million. But the data supported prices only briefly before both WTI and Brent fell to its lowest intra-day level since last August.Now the focus is on whether the OPEC is considering deeper cuts.However, three other OPEC delegates in comments to Reuters dismissed the idea of a new cut.One of officials close to OPEC said that he doesn’t think the cartel will agree on further and deeper cuts unless Iran would accept being included in the cut.[VANDANA HARI, Vanda Insights Founder] “They absolutely need to do act . It will cost them dearly if they are sitting on their hands. There’s too much of stake, especially for the Saudis as the de facto OPEC leader. As a country getting ready of the very critical IPO of Aramco next year, they just can not afford price below 50, I think.”Meanwhile, oil market participants were assessing on Wednesday the potential impact upon the world’s most traded commodity of the momentous overnight leadership change announced within Saudi Arabia’s ruling family.Early Wednesday, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman unveiled his decision to relieve 57-year-old Interior Minister Muhammad bin Nayef of his position as crown prince in favor of his 31-year-old son, Deputy Crown Prince and Defense Minister Mohammad bin Salman.However, market analysts expect that the newly named Crown Prince is unlikely to make changes to oil production policy, but his more aggressive foreign policy stance could at some point put a political risk premium back in the price of oil, according to RBC.[VANDANA HARI, Vanda Insights Founder] “Mohammed bin Salman was always in charge of oil policy as far as I can see. From his very famous interview with the Economist, where he announced that Aramco is going to IPO, and his Vision 2030 as well, so he was alwasy in charge. Not that he’s wanting a mandate, but I think if anything now, he probablity will go ahead with a little more perhaps conviction, a little more stability, a little more predictability into the longer term, so we are talking about 10, 15, 20 years perhaps.”Bin Salman is also spearheading Vision 2030, a plan to diversify the economy away from its dependence on oil, and there could be new momentum with the change in leadership, she noted. A center piece of the plan is the public offering of state-owned Saudi Aramco, expected next year.But for the short-term, the key question is still -- what can and will Saudi Arabia do to bolster the oil price before the Saudi Aramco’s IPO next year.CNBC’s Qian Chen, reporting from Singapore.",pos
"While it’s working hard to diversify and modernize its economy, Saudi Arabia is stumbling in its effort to establish a financial center in the kingdom. Emblematic of the problem is the fact that Riyadh’s King Abdullah Financial District, begun a decade ago, has more skyscrapers than tenants.Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman’s Vision 2030 plan to turn the kingdom into an investment powerhouse, ballyhooed at first, is meeting more skepticism as MBS, as the crown prince is known, launches ever larger visions. Investors are beginning to question not only the $2 trillion valuation of Saudi Aramco but whether the IPO of 5 percent of the shares of the state-owned oil company will happen at all.Last year Riyadh fell backward a notch on rankings of global financial centers, according to the London-based Z/Yen Group’s Global Financial Centres Index, which is based on surveys of professionals working in the market. What makes the story in Riyadh interesting is why establishing a financial sector is turning into such a struggle. After all, the Kingdom has massive wealth — the most recent display of it being the possibility, reported by Elon Musk, that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has approached him to invest enough money to turn Tesla into a private company.A look at the city in the Middle East that has succeeded in establishing a financial center, Dubai, offers some clues to where Riyadh might be falling short. The keys are delivering on the small, steady steps of reform; the changes in tax and legal codes that enable business and finance; and building a culture and society open enough to draw a global expat community.“If I had to sum up in one word what I have learnt about financial centres over the past 15 years of studying them, that word would be ‘trust,’” said Mark Yeandle, the lead author of the Financial Centres Index, by email. “Dubai have built up a good track record. Riyadh does not yet have this.”Of course, Saudi Arabia’s stumbles may be momentary. The country’s financial sector got a boost late this spring when MSCI announced in June that it would include Saudi Arabia in its emerging markets index, which means billions in institutional investors’ capital will flow into the stock market, already the region’s largest. The change came after Saudi regulators enabled foreign investors to own up to 49 percent of listed securities. The iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (KSA) is the No. 1 performer among all single-country funds in 2018. Even as the recent slide in crude oil has lowered its year-to-date return from over 20 percent to 12 percent, it remains the top-performing stock market in the world, and one of only about a dozen that are generating positive performance this year.MBS needs to diversify the economy rapidly if the country is to avoid what the World Bank called a “looming poverty crisis” brought on by lingering low oil prices and rich state benefits. The World Bank is forecasting a 1.8 percent growth in GDP this year, with more than 2 percent expected for next year, based on the continuing commitment to reform and a recovery in oil production. More than $1 trillion of the $3.5 trillion GDP comes from the oil sector.Saudi officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment.A financial sector that can finance domestic deals and serve as a bridge for external investment is crucial. But Riyadh’s path to transformation is seeming much rockier than that of Dubai. In less than two generations, Dubai went from a trading post with no paved roads to the top financial center in Africa and the Middle East. It also became one of the five fastest-growing cities between 2010 and 2015, according to the Brookings Institution. It is still rising in stature as it draws blockchain investment and finishes preparations for the World Expo in 2020.In some ways, Saudi Arabia is borrowing pages from Dubai’s playbook. Both countries, for instance, have been tax havens for foreigners and the native-born population, as neither have personal income taxes. But while Dubai moved aggressively to establish a reputation as a place friendly to foreign businesses by creating dozens of special zones with tax incentives and special regulations, Saudi Arabia has been slower. It has established a bankruptcy law, but not the codes that would lay out how the law will be implemented. In 2015 it was working on about a half-dozen economic zones, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Saudi Arabia this year established a VAT to help make up its budget shortfall.Ten years ago, when Riyadh first started working on diversification, announcing a $10 billion investment in the King Abdullah Financial District, it was envisioned as a sort of mini Dubai. MBS’s 2030 plan calls for Riyadh to be an investment powerhouse and, like Dubai, a bridge between three continents. The district was built but has struggled to attract tenants, according to Yeandle and others.PricewaterhouseCoopers, which reportedly was planning to take space in the district, said through a spokeswoman that it couldn’t comment on the reports. Dubai has become an expert in guerilla tactics to establish its reputation as a hub for fintech. For instance, it offers targeted investments and government contracts to top start-ups worldwide to lure fast-growth companies to the emirate.Saudi Arabia likewise plans to invest heavily in fintech and innovation, but it is leveraging its own wealth. For instance, state-owned company Alhamrani Group is investing in blockchain and has established a company called Ateon, a solutions provider and systems integrator in the fintech space that focuses on blockchain and cybersecurity. One of the company’s initiatives was automating the record-keeping for the VAT, which is designed to be collected in Saudi Arabia at every step of a product’s life cycle, said Husam Yaghi, Ateon president.“A big chunk of that Vision 2030 is that digital transformation in fintech,” said Yaghi. Saudi Arabia’s central bank has also joined Ripple, the cryptocurrency that major banks, including Santander, Bank of America and UBS, are using to make global financial transactions easier.Saudi Arabia is also using a tactic other petrochemical states, like Kuwait, have tried: investing in companies abroad, or becoming a co-investor with leading foreign companies, to spur industry at home. Before the Tesla headlines — which the Saudis have so far been quiet on — MBS announced back in March a deal with SoftBank’s Vision Fund to develop a $5 billion solar project, the world’s largest, though the fund didn’t name a location.The project, for which SoftBank is investing $1 billion, is expected to have the capacity to produce 200 gigawatts of energy by 2030. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, invested $250 million in the Vision Fund from the Saudi Public Investment Fund. (The Financial Times recently reported that the Public Investment Fund may be falling short on some of its infrastructure investment goals, perhaps because of the delay in the Aramco IPO.)What Saudi Arabia hasn’t been able to do is establish rapid trust and innovation like Dubai did. It turned itself into a city that tourists wanted to visit, expats wanted to live in and where the native-born population wanted to work. It’s estimated that 70 percent of its population is from other countries. To the extent that those transplants were professionals with established networks to their home countries or regions, Dubai has benefited. The emirate has also leveraged its status as an underdog to inspire its native-born population. Dubai is getting set to hold the World Expo in 2020, which is expected to draw more than 17 million people. The leftover infrastructure is expected to offer another economic boost to the city. Siemens, for instance, has committed to moving its global logistics headquarters to office space in the Expo, which will also have a 5G network.The Dubai government is well aware of the well-financed efforts a few hundred miles away. “We look around us every day very carefully,” said Marjan Faraidooni, head of legacy at Expo 2020 Dubai. “It just fuels us to be more creative. If other cities want to be more competitive, it will drive us more. Dubai does not have oil reserves. We were driven to be competitive globally.”When it comes to building a finance sector in an emerging market, nothing trumps the elusive trust factor. Lacking codified investment and corporate laws, emerging markets’ leaders have to develop a reputation for following through on what they say. Dubai’s leadership — Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid — has established trust with outside investors. When he has launched initiatives, he has largely followed through, Yeandle said.So far, Saudi Arabia hasn’t developed that kind of track record. MBS has said the kingdom will build a $500 billion innovation city, Neom, whose economy will be linked to Jordan and Egypt. The plans to nurture innovation and technology are drawing interest from across the region, said Vera Futorjanski, a futurist who worked with the Dubai Future Foundation, but like other initiatives, the plans are only plans at this point.To many foreigners, Saudi Arabia is still mostly a closed door — it’s still difficult even to get a visa there. And MBS is an unknown character, as is the extent to which the crown prince can counter, or wants to counter, religious extremists who might try to block social and economic reform as it becomes more difficult, said one source in the country.MBS made world headlines when the kingdom allowed women to drive, but at the same time, the women who advocated for the change for years before the driving ban was lifted have been jailed. In other words, it’s one thing to announce reforms and another to actually see them through. “You will only invest in a place, and put your money in a place, if you trust the people who work there and the institutions that govern their behavior,” Yeandle said. “Whilst Saudi has massive and undisputed wealth, there is a sense of being an untried centre, which in a pretty autocratic country is beholden to their leader.”",pos
"President Donald Trump's plea to Saudi Arabia to award the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the listing of Saudi Aramco, the Kingdom's national oil company, came only a day or so before the country's de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, locked up dozens of the country's political and business elite and froze billions of dollars of their assets.Yet, none of this seems to have changed Trump's opinion that hosting the IPO (initial public offering) in Wall Street is, to quote his November 4 tweet, ""important to the United States.""  Trump's eagerness to win the biggest IPO in history stems from his view that the soaring stock market is the best reflection of what he views as the success of his economic policies. By adding Aramco to the S&P 500, Trump hopes to continue the rally deep into 2018 and beyond, even if his tax plan were to falter.He knows that such a mammoth IPO, estimated at $100 billion, would beef up the stocks of potential underwriters like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan as well as scores of service providers associated with the offering.He also hopes that a New York IPO would solidify U.S.-Saudi relations even beyond the $350 billion arms deal signed between the two countries earlier this year, bringing more lucrative deals down the road.To win these short term gains Trump is prepared to compromise the integrity of our economic system, exposing American investors to some serious and irreversible financial, legal and ethical challenges.  Taking public a company like Aramco entails disclosures the company was never willing to make. For example, it requires the Saudis to share with the public its detailed geological data, its well-by-well production costs, its precise financial relations with the Saudi government and its hiring and operating procedures. All of those have been closely guarded state secrets. But it is far from certain that the Saudi government, which effectively runs Aramco, will be ready to open its books, and even if it did it will only do so for the 5 percent of the company offered to the public while keeping the veil of secrecy on the other 95 percent.  This begs the question which assets or business segments will fall within the 5 percent? What will be their interaction with the other 95 percent of the company retained under state control? Will shareholders of the 5 percent be accountable to decisions made by the 95 percent? Who decides?  This issue is particularly important since while the 5 percent will supposedly be governed by free market forces, the 95 percent will be effectively steered by a price-fixing cartel — OPEC — the very same organization that Trump has been criticizing for years for cheating America through oil price manipulations.  OPEC members collectively own more than two thirds of the world's conventional crude reserves and they account for one third of global production. Over the past 40 years non-OPEC production has doubled yet the cartel's production has barely changed and is around 32 million barrels per day. It can affect oil prices at will in ways no other player in the oil market can.  Saudi Aramco is not only the largest producer within OPEC, it is also the driving force behind the cartel's decisions, including the most recent one to extend oil production cuts in order to support prices. Since oil export is the main source of income for the Saudi government, OPEC's decisions will always be subservient to the Kingdom's budgetary needs.If floated in New York, Aramco's shares will be present in almost every portfolio of every pension fund, mutual fund and premium stock index. This means that thanks to Trump's economic carelessness in one way or another most Americans will be invested in it. Hence, by extension, most Americans will be forced to be in collusion with a cartel and at times benefit from its price fixing.  The association with OPEC will put in legal jeopardy any oil executive wishing to hold fiduciary responsibility in Aramco. Under U.S. law, officers of companies engaged in price fixing go to jail, but executives of OPEC members are doing so in broad daylight every few months in Vienna. However, bringing Aramco under American securities law will change the rules for those executives and expose them — as well as the NYSE itself — to numerous lawsuits. This will deter Western executives from assuming positions in Aramco, leading the company to be governed by a cabal of diplomatically immune Saudi royals rather than seasoned oil and investment professionals.  One would hope that a president surrounded by so many Wall Street veterans would exercise better judgment before lending his support to such a problematic IPO. Prior to becoming president, Trump often complained that his predecessor Barack Obama let OPEC nations take advantage of America. Trump is committing a far bigger sin: offering to usher the most objectionable form of market distortion into the heart of America's financial system. He, and his economic team, should know better.

"A United Arab Emirates state-owned oil giant made a positive stock market debut Wednesday, a listing likely to resonate through the Middle East as several other companies prepare to go public. The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) listed a stake in its fuel distribution unit, called  ADNOC Distribution. John Carey, the deputy CEO of ADNOC Distribution, told CNBC that though the initial public offering (IPO) of this unit was “a long time coming,” he was “really excited” about the company’s prospects. When asked how important it would be for the group’s public listing to do well given the interest among other companies in the region looking to follow suit, Carey replied: “Investors looked at the United Arab Emirates ... and for us, we need to lead the way, we need to build that credibility and I believe our plans do that.”Carey also told reporters the group would look to expand its fuel stations into Dubai and Saudi Arabia next year. “ADNOC Distribution relies on its customers and we are going to grow with them,” he said.ADNOC announced it would sell the 10 percent stake in its distribution unit in November and has raised $851 million, according to Reuters. The company had initially planned to sell as much as a 20 percent stake, however, and had lowered the top end of its offer price.On Wednesday, shares of ADNOC Distribution rose sharply at the open, trading at 2.9 dirhams (0.79 cents) shortly after the bell versus an IPO price of 2.50 dirhams per share.  ADNOC’s fuel-distribution IPO is set to become the first of many in the Middle East as companies based in Abu Dhabi and other Gulf states are privatizing energy assets in order to compete in an era of cheap crude. Wednesday’s price surge won’t go unnoticed among investors eagerly awaiting the listing of state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco in 2018. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year that Aramco is worth at least $2 trillion. ADNOC has been in the midst of a major restructuring since Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber was appointed as the company’s chief executive in 2016. The oil industry has been forced to cut costs and search for ways to boost efficiency since the price of oil collapsed from nearly $120 a barrel in June 2014. The sharp drop in prices was caused by weak demand, a strong dollar and booming U.S. shale production. ADNOC produces around 3 million barrels of oil per day, accounting for approximately 3 percent of global production. The UAE-based firm also produces almost 10 billion cubic feet of raw gas per day, meaning it is one of the leading energy producers in the world. —CNBC’s Holly Ellyatt and Reuters contributed to this report.",pos

It’s PossibleCompetition, and Debt, Could Spell Trouble for VerizonLyft Is Said to Explore I.P.O. as It Raises $1 Billion Led by AlphabetA red carpet and dozens of emissaries for the royal family waited as guests began streaming into the Ritz-Carlton here, a palatial hotel originally planned as a palace for guests of the royal family and state dignitaries.The gathering is an illustration of the new power and influence that Saudi Arabia wields in the business world. The goal is to demonstrate the kingdom’s transformation as it embarks on a massive experiment: to open up its economy and move away from being a nation that is almost entirely dependent on oil.“Saudi Arabia is moving aggressively to diversify its economy and implement important reforms,” Mr. Schwarzman told me, explaining why so much of the world’s business community has become intrigued by the kingdom as an economic and business partner.Among those reforms is the recent decision to allow women to drive. One senior Saudi female executive told me that she had owned a Mercedes for years and couldn’t wait to learn how to drive it; like many women here, she has needed a driver to take her to and from work.But to truly understand where the country’s new influence over the business community comes from, you simply need to follow the money.With Saudi Arabia looking to invest the proceeds of its oil sales in new businesses and industries — it is planning an initial public offering for its state-owned oil company, Aramco, next year — the kingdom represents perhaps the largest honey pot in history. Virtually everyone here will have his or her pitch book at the ready and a hand out.“They think of the Saudis as big money,” said Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political research and consulting firm. “Not smart, not dumb, but really big money that’s ready to move. And that attracts an extraordinary number of people who’d like a little piece.”Wall Street’s biggest companies are sending swarms of bankers here, as are private equity firms and hedge funds. One executive described the gathering as “a ring-kissing exercise,” an effort by businesses to prove their loyalty as the country’s Public Investment Fund — which is the formal sponsor of the event — begins to dole out hundreds of billions of dollars as part of its diversification plan, known as Vision 2030.Mr. Schwarzman’s Blackstone and Mr. Son’s SoftBank have so far been the biggest beneficiaries of Saudi Arabia’s largess. This year, the country committed $20 billion to a new Blackstone fund to be used, in part, to fix aging infrastructure in the United States. And it gave $45 billion to Mr. Son’s SoftBank Vision Fund, the largest technology fund in the world.It has already made investments in WeWork, SoFi and Fanatics, and is negotiating an investment in Uber. Speaking of Uber, Travis Kalanick, its former chief executive and a current board member, is expected here; the Saudis invested $3.5 billion directly in Uber last year.A number of participants, speaking anonymously so as not to offend their hosts, grumbled about what they described as having to trek to the desert to get their picture taken. Others said attendance was mandatory because the kingdom was a client. One executive, unprompted, said bankers would be taking selfies to put in pitch books for future business in Saudi Arabia.Journalists from around the world are also here at the conference. (I’m among the many journalists interviewing executives and officials on panels.)Topic A in the hallways is the initial public offering for Aramco. There have been reports recently that the I.P.O. might be delayed or that the government might sell a stake in the company to the Chinese, either as an alternative to the public offering or as a way to help establish a valuation.The kingdom is said to be seeking a valuation of $2 trillion for Aramco, which would make it the largest company in the world — and give the government enough money to pursue its diversification strategy. But some investors and analysts, who have yet to see any of Aramco’s financials, have warned that such a valuation is far too high.At stake is Saudi Arabia’s ability to pay for its transformation. And for many of the attendees, the kingdom’s ability to pay huge fees to Wall Street also hangs in the balance. The fees from the I.P.O. offering are estimated to be worth as much $1 billion, which would make it the biggest payday ever for an offering. With questions still lingering about where the I.P.O will be listed, it is notable that Thomas W. Farley, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, and Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, are both scheduled to attend.In an interview over the weekend, Aramco’s chief executive, Amin H. Nasser,  insisted the I.P.O. was still on track for next year.“We have always said that we will be listing in 2018 and, to be more specific, in the second half of 2018,” he said. “However, I think journalists and writers — they are expecting more and more information, and we are governed by, you know, certain rules with regard to talking about the I.P.O. and all of that.”When Aramco will go public and at what price will most likely be the chatter of the week, if not a full-fledged parlor game, but the real question, Mr. Bremmer said, “is what anyone can learn about the internal dynamics of the royal family?”There are continuing questions about whether the kingdom’s investments in new industries and businesses will be able to produce the kind of returns that oil has for generations here.And just as important, there are questions about whether the diversification strategy can create enough jobs to keep the population employed and expand the domestic economy.“How much support is there for the aggressive across-the-board reforms of Vision 2030?” Mr. Bremmer asked. “Do attendees come away with any more confidence that Saudi isn’t only on the right track but that they can execute on it? We shall see.”The answer will have a huge impact on the future of this country — and will be worth a lot of money.",pos
"The U.K. is bending over backwards to welcome Saudi Arabia’s crown prince as he starts a three-day state visit aimed at deepening economic ties between the two countries.Banners promoting Saudi-U.K. links have appeared in London, where Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he is known, arrived on Tuesday evening.He is due to have lunch with Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday and dinner with Prince Charles and the Duke of Cambridge, William, in the evening.He is also due to meet Prime Minister Theresa May and ministers, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, at the prime minister’s residence in Downing Street, Wednesday.Meetings over the next three days are expected to focus on defense, security and economic ties, Downing Street said as it issued more details of the crown prince’s visit. The two countries are set to launch a “Strategic Partnership Council” aimed at fostering closer economic and cultural relations, with billions of dollars worth of potential deals within the partnership.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s schedule on Wednesday:His visit is the first to the U.K. since he became crown prince in June 2017 (he is also defense minister) and since Saudi Arabia started its “major program of domestic reforms,” with the U.K. government hoping for deeper relations with the Middle Eastern superpower.“Saudi Arabia is among the largest political, diplomatic and economic powers in the Middle East, and the visit will usher in a new era in our bilateral relations with one of our oldest friends in the region,” the U.K. government said in a press release Tuesday.Saudi Arabia appears to have seen the visit as an opportunity for good public relations, with large ads taking out in a number of national newspapers. Financial Times journalist Peter Spiegel remarked on the prominent pro-Saudi segments in Wednesday’s press.Mohamed Abdelmeguid, a Saudi Arabia analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), said he was sure new Saudi-U.K. commercial partnerships will be signed during the visit but noted that “Brexit creates a lot of uncertainty for foreign investors.” He added that this could be sufficient to derail planned investments before they reach execution level.The planned initial public offering (IPO) of state oil giant Saudi Aramco (London is competing with New York to be the stock exchange where the company is listed overseas) is also expected to be discussed, the EIU’s Abdelmeguid said.“London will be competing with other capitals over the forthcoming (Saudi Aramco) IPO so there is probably going to be some talk about the listing. He will need to announce something soon though, as we are already in March and Saudi officials had previously suggested the IPO was planned for mid-2018.”The 32-year-old crown prince has made waves in Saudi Arabia for the economic and cultural reforms he has promoted since being named heir to the throne, the most notable reforms ranging from the much-vaunted “Vision 2030” to diversify the economy away from oil, to lifting a ban on cinemas and women driving in Saudi Arabia.The U.K. government said Vision 2030 will provide opportunities for British businesses in sectors including education, entertainment and health care “where they have world-class expertise.”“It also includes plans for Saudi Arabia to become a global investment powerhouse and the crown prince’s visit will help explore ways in which Saudi Arabia can build on its investment in the U.K. in sectors such as infrastructure,” the government added.Aside from overseeing radical departures from tradition in the religiously conservative country, the heir to the Saudi kingdom also instigated a crackdown on corruption that saw ministers, businessmen and even fellow princes arrested and detained in 2017.His youth and enthusiasm for reform work in his favor, in a country where the majority of the population is young and eager for work. Out of a total population of around 32.5 million people, the majority are in their mid-30s or younger, according to government data. The state-controlled Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said the crown prince is being accompanied by a delegation including the Saudi ambassador to the U.K., the country’s minister of commerce and investment, minister of health, minister of energy, minister of education and the economy and culture ministers.Yet Saudi Arabia is not without its critics, who lament its poor record on human rights, draconian executions of political prisoners and military intervention in the civil war in Yemen, a conflict that has caused a humanitarian disaster in the country and one which is seen as a proxy war between the kingdom and its regional rival, Iran.Prime Minister May has been criticized by political opponents in the U.K. for inviting the crown prince and human rights protesters have said they are going to hold demonstrations in London during the visit.Arms sales between the U.K. and Saudi Arabia are a moot point for protesters. The Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) is among a broad range of human rights groups planning to protest at Downing Street on Wednesday afternoon. It said in a statement that a Populus poll of 2,000 people (carried out for CAAT) showed that only 6 percent of the U.K. population supported arms sales to Saudi Arabia.CAAT states that U.K. government data it has compiled show that since the Saudi-led coalition began airstrikes on Yemen in 2015, “the U.K. has licensed £4.6 billion ($6.3 billion) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia, including £2.7 billion worth of ML10 licenses (aircraft, helicopters, drones) and £1.9 billion worth of ML4 licenses (grenades, bombs, missiles, countermeasures).”The U.K. government said that the meeting “will help to enhance our co-operation in tackling international challenges such as terrorism, extremism, the conflict and humanitarian crisis in Yemen and other regional issues such as Iraq and Syria.”",pos
" Saudi Arabia is considering listing its state-owned oil producer, Saudi Aramco, The Economist reported, citing the kingdom’s deputy crown  prince Muhammad bin Salman.  Aramco is the world’s largest crude oil producer and if the initial public offer goes through, Saudi Aramco would rank as one of the most highly valued listed companies globally.A possible listing of the oil giant will help  bolster Saudi government finances after the current rout in oil price  contributed to a record 367 billion Saudi riyals ($97.9 billion) budget deficit in 2015.″I believe it is in the interest of the  Saudi market, and it is in the interest of Aramco, and it is for  the interest of more transparency, and to counter corruption, if  any, that may be circling around  Aramco,” Prince Muhammad told the  newspaper in an interview conducted on January 4.   A decision on whether to float Aramco is likely to be made in the next few months, he added.  Oil prices halved in the last year and hit 12-year lows this  week amid market turmoil in the Chinese markets.  To read the full Economist story, click here.

"Stories of Mohammed bin Salman's state visit to the U.K. took a bipolar approach in the British press this week.Some accounted for the Saudi crown prince's reformist agenda sweeping through the historically conservative nation. Others spoke of protests coupled with the visit, highlighting human rights abuses in Yemen. Some were simply left perplexed by the PR drive from the Middle Eastern nation, which saw Bin Salman's face plastered on billboards and black cabs in London.The crown prince's reforms have ushered in sweeping changes across Saudi Arabia; notably allowing females to drive, and the lifting of a 35-year-old ban on cinemas. But the 32-year-old Bin Salman has also stunned onlookers, especially with the 2017 purge that saw the arrests of over 30 princes, businessmen, and government ministers.In the U.K., there are some who have used the visit to forge better ties between Britain and Saudi Arabia. For example, Chris Innes-Hopkins, the executive director at the Saudi British Joint Business Council (SBJBC), an independent and private sector-led body, hosted a number of high level executives from Saudi Arabia off the back of the trip. He saw the moment as a means to build a mutually-beneficial partnership of long term investment and trade.But more specifically, it was the impending Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO) that sent the most tongues wagging. Especially amongst the finance buffs of the City of London which has been shortlisted for the international portion of the state oil giant's listing.The flotation could be the  largest in history and is a topic attracting not only the attention of British investors, but also of the U.K. parliament. James Slack, spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May stated that the visit would usher in a new era of bilateral ""relations focused on delivering wide-ranging benefits.""But, Rachel Reeves, a Labour party politician and the chair of the Business Committee in the House of Commons, is less eager for London to pursue the listing.""It's easy to see why the City (of London) and highly-remunerated advisors cheerlead for this listing, but the U.K. currently has strict corporate governance rules and it's vital these aren't watered down in a bid to attract Saudi Aramco. This risks our world-class reputation for corporate governance and could ultimately damage the U.K.'s attractiveness to foreign investment,"" she told CNBC via email.Aside from discussions on the Aramco IPO, were headlines of the Saudi prince eyeing billion-dollar investment deals for the U.K. Wednesday evening headlines verified the success of the trip, boasting a goal of around £65 billion ($90.3 billion) of investment in the coming years.May said in a statement: ""This is a significant boost for U.K. prosperity and a clear demonstration of the strong international confidence in our economy as we prepare to leave the European Union.""But there are skeptics that these announcements would ever see fruition, with the Financial Times noting on Thursday that President Donald Trump's deals with the country last year have yet to fully materialize.In October 2017, Saudi Arabia impressed at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh by announcing plans for a $500 billion business zone reaching into Jordan and Egypt. However, speaking to Reuters, some executives said they ""remained concerned about Riyadh's ability to execute its plans."" Though, they chose not to be named to avoid risking their chances of winning business.Christopher Davidson, author of ""After the Sheikhs,"" a book that explores the collapse of Gulf monarchies, has also questioned this week's announcements.""I would be cautious if I were in Number 10 (Downing Street) or the White House to really expect Saudi to come up with this,"" he told CNBC.""History tells us it can't. From Saudi's perspective, their promises are being lapped up, both whom, for their own reasons, need to score points at home by saying they have big international trade partners.""Friday is set to be the last day for Mohammed bin Salman's U.K. trip, but his ""Vision 2030"" expansion continues with an official visit to the U.S. on March 19.",pos
"The so-called corruption crackdown in Saudi Arabia over the weekend may be the beginning of a bigger power struggle by the heir apparent to the throne which destabilizes the region for a time and keeps oil prices elevated.Following the creation of an anti-corruption committee by current King Salman, security forces Saturday swept up 11 princes, including well-known billionaire invest Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, and four ministers, including the one in charge of the National Guard, according to various reports. A number of former ministers were also arrested.Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman — the 32-year-old known as “MBS” who will take over when King Salman, 81, abdicates the throne later this year or early next — is seen by analysts as the man behind those moves in an effort to consolidate power to his family and its allies before he takes the throne.“Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman’s (MBS’) Saturday night purge represents a stunning political development in Saudi Arabia and a shot across the bow at the old establishment,” wrote Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy for RBC Capital Markets in a Sunday note to clients. “The key question now is whether MBS has launched or preempted a new destabilizing ‘Game of Thrones’ by arresting his relatives in such dramatic fashion.”Brent crude oil futures jumped to their highest since July 2015 in early trading Sunday evening, while U.S. WTI futures were also trading higher to $55.82 a barrel following the weekend drama.The short-term and medium-term outlook for oil looks bullish, according to the note by Croft, who is one of the most widely-followed commodity analysts on Wall Street.In the short term, analysts are focusing on the detention of Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the head of the Saudi Arabian National Guard, as a sign the struggle is much bigger and will be more tumultuous than it currently looks. The National Guard is in charge of keeping the population in line.“While MBS’ supporters insist that Saturday’s move had absolutely nothing to do with staving off a coup and maintain that it was entirely about eradicating corruption, detaining Mutaib does also seemingly serve a broader power consolidation agenda,” wrote Croft. “The fact that private airstrips were closed on Saturday also does suggest that more high-level arrests may be looming.”History shows, that when there is turmoil within Saudi Arabia, oil prices head higher. If the young prince is ultimately trying to fight extremism, there could be protests led by clerics among the population. Using Kensho, CNBC looked at what happened to oil prices one month after major protests within Saudi Arabia. A month later, the international crude benchmark was 2.7 percent higher, on average, according to Kensho. Crude prices in the U.S. followed the lead, gaining more than 2 percent, on average, as well.The medium-term outlook is also bullish for oil because the crown prince will likely uphold and extend the OPEC production cuts, according to RBC. “In terms of oil, there was no talk of returning to market share in Riyadh last week and $60/bbl Brent provides a more optimal enabling environment for many of MBS’ key initiatives to remake the economy,” said Croft’s note. “Hence, we continue to see Saudi Arabia actively supporting market management, extending the OPEC cut deep into 2018, and moving ahead with the planned sale of a stake in Aramco.”Saudi rulers likely also would like to keep oil prices stable ahead of the planned IPO of state oil company Saudi Aramco expected next year.Longer term, however, the crown prince’s rule could be bearish for oil. He is trying to diversify the kingdom away from its reliance on crude revenues. The Aramco IPO is part of that process. A new $500 billion mega-city powered by renewable energy is part of that diversification plan as well — it’s also a sign of just how bold the man is currently winning this “Game of Thrones.” Disclosure: NBCUniversal, parent of CNBC, is a minority investor in Kensho.",pos

"Electric vehicle purchases are expected to surge in the coming years, but making conventional, gas-powered cars and trucks more efficient will be the most effective way of driving down emissions in the near term, Saudi Aramco’s chief technology officer said.Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, is investing in technologies that will allow the internal combustion engine to burn gasoline more efficiently. Much of that research is being done at a research facility near Detroit.The initiative comes at a time when several European countries, China and California have announced plans to ban the use, sale or production of vehicles with combustion engines under the hood. In Norway, that deadline is 2025, while in many other areas the prohibition won’t come until 2040.However, the internal combustion engine will continue to propel most of the world’s vehicles for the foreseeable future, Saudi Aramco CTO Ahmad Al Khowaiter told CNBC on the sidelines of the Detroit Auto Show.  “Electric vehicles have a role to play, but we believe the most effective means to bring down emissions is to actually improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine,” he said.The number of electric vehicles grew to about 2 million in 2016, a nearly 60 percent rise from the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency.But that is still just 0.2 percent of all cars on the road, and hybrid-electric vehicles, which include gas engines, accounted for about 40 percent of all electric vehicles in 2016.Still, fuel efficiency standards are getting tougher around the world, said Khowaiter, who believes there are many opportunities to increase the combustion engine’s efficiency.Aramco has worked with European and American automakers to advance gasoline compression ignition, a technology that allows gas-powered engines to roughly match the efficiency of diesel engines.Asked whether he’s worried about a U.S. ban on the internal combustion energy, Khowaiter said polices that attempt to pick winners are often counterproductive.“We believe policy should be technology agnostic. Let the best technology win because that usually serves the best purpose for policy,” he said.Saudi Aramco is planning to take a portion of the company public in what is widely expected to be the world’s biggest ever share offering. The initial public offering is part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans to create the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund and diversify Saudi Arabia’s oil-dependent economy.Khowaiter declined to comment on the IPO.",pos
"Saudi Arabia and Russia put their weight behind a new agreement to curb oil production, a deal analysts say should drive up crude prices but also underscores a growing alliance between the two countries.The oil ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia on Monday said they would consult other nations on an agreement to extend the current production deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers by nine months, about three months longer than the market expected.The deal to keep 1.8 million barrels of crude from the market is likely to embolden U.S. shale producers to ramp up their production, but it is also a deal that both Russia and Saudi Arabia would see as politically expedient and critical to their domestic finances.""For the Saudis, as for all the other exporters, low prices could really create enormous stress. They really want to solve this issue,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit.""For the Russians, they've seen their sovereign wealth fund deplete quickly, and the oil revenues are a big part of the government budget,"" he said.The extension of the production deal was also announced just days before President Donald Trump visits Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip, which also includes Israel and Rome. ""Think about what they get from Trump and the Republicans. They want to get a whole lot of precision-guided missiles,"" said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC. Besides discussing weapons deals, she said, Saudi Arabia wants to know the U.S. ""fully has their back and we will do what it takes to roll back Iranian influence.""Russian energy minister Alexander Novak and Saudi Arabia energy minister Khalid al-Falih announced their support for an extension of the deal at a joint briefing in Beijing on Monday after a meeting of the G-20 countries.Saudi Arabia had felt the pinch of lower prices, though several weeks ago it reversed a move to withhold some pay and benefits to government workers, a move analysts saw as a possible effort to ward off unrest.Saudi Arabia also needs a high oil price to help its plan to diversify its economy away from crude, under its Vision 2030 plan. The cornerstone of that plan is the IPO of the state-owned energy company Saudi Aramco, which analysts say would do better with a higher oil price.For Russia, higher oil prices have helped its economy. ""This is the first year they were out of recession. … What was the only good news for Russia? The oil price. I don't think it's a coincidence they're extending it to March,"" said Croft.Edward Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup, said he believes there's a 60 to 70 percent chance the deal could also include deeper cuts than the 1.8 million barrels a day already agreed to late last year. He expects the market to rebalance and West Texas Intermediate crude to be up to $62 per barrel by the end of the year.He also said it's not surprising Russia and Saudi Arabia are moving closer together to solve their common problem of low oil prices.""There are three giant oil producers in the world,"" he said. ""Two of them are petro-states, demonstrably dependent on oil revenues for government budget purposes. One of them is not, in the U.S. They have common interests in increasing their revenues. They can do it at the margin. This is impactful.""He said one will end that relationship first. ""I think Russia has more of a dilemma in a volume versus price tradeoff.""Saudi Arabia has borne the lion's share of the production cuts, announced in December and effective in January, and Morse said they would no doubt take on more if there are deeper cuts.Even before the original deal was announced in December, oil prices ran up on speculation and continued to hold in the $50s for several months. But continuing large inventory builds in the U.S., rising production, and more supply from Libya and elsewhere ramped up speculation that the world would remain oversupplied.""You have this new world order with Saudi and Russia,"" said Croft. ""This is not a one-off, that Russia got involved in OPEC. … It's not like Russia joined OPEC, but you have this new framework. Putin's influence in the Middle East has done nothing but soar, as [the U.S.] pulled back.""She said the relationship between Saudi Arabia and President Barack Obama was not good, since he wanted broader U.S. relations in the region. ""What they want to hear is the reset with Iran is over; goodbye to all of that,"" she said.The Trump administration has taken a harsher tone with Iran, after the Obama administration struck a deal with Iran on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions against it.""It's not an accident that the two countries [Russia and Saudi Arabia] were moving together at a time when maybe [the relationship between] the United States and Saudi Arabia was problematic,"" Morse said. ""It's become a lot less problematic since President Trump was elected.""Chris Weafer, partner with Macro-Advisory, said Russia ramped up production ahead of the deal last fall, so its cuts have not been that painful. But a boost in the price of oil will help its budget, which is based on $40 oil.""If it means $55 instead of $40, it's $25 billion for the budget,"" he said. ""But in terms of politics, it means the Saudis owe the Russians a favor. … It means the Russian position in Syria which the Saudis criticized, they are no longer criticizing.""Weafer said there are also rumors that the Saudis would be interested in investing in Russian energy.""We have the Russians supporting not just OPEC but mainly Saudi Arabia. [Extending] the production cuts is being pushed by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. For him, he wants the Aramco IPO to be successful, and for that, he needs $55 oil. I think that's why this deal has been pushed. For Russia, It's good politics,"" said Weafer. Bin Salman is also behind the Saudi Vision 2030 plan to diversify the economy away from oil.Croft said the timing of the OPEC production extension coincides with the Russian presidential election next March, another reason Russia may have been keen to strike a new deal.""I don't think anyone thinks Putin will lose. He doesn't want protesters. I don't think Putin wants to risk a significant uptick in discontent going into those elections,"" she said.Thousands of Russians protested last weekend about a plan by the city of Moscow to tear down Soviet-era housing.""I think what greatly concerned the Kremlin was that ordinary people protested. … The idea of real people in the streets with some real issue, they freak, and they address it very quickly,"" said Weafer.""Both leaders, both governments are concerned about social issues on the back of tighter budgets. For Saudi, the deputy crown prince has really staked a lot on the budget revisions, on the 2030 program, and also getting Aramco away at a very high rate,"" said Weafer. Other members of OPEC are expected to endorse the agreement at their May 25 meeting.West Texas Intermediate edged back toward $50, settling up 2.1 percent at $48.85 per barrel Monday, and Brent, the international benchmark, was at just under $52 per barrel.Watch: Crude higher for fourth straight session",pos
"President Donald Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia could be a boost for the big ambitions of Saudi Arabia’s young deputy crown prince, who is trying to steer the kingdom’s fortunes away from oil.For Mohammed bin Salman, the U.S. brings an arms deal worth $350 billion over a decade, while affirming its decades long support as Saudi Arabia’s regional power struggle with Iran intensifies. For Trump, it’s a reset of what was a less friendly U.S.-Saudi relationship under President Barack Obama, and a show of Saudi support for the U.S. in the fight against ISIS.“I think Trump will relish spending time in a country that is absolutely thrilled with his election. MBS will be looking for assurances that we will work alongside the Kingdom in rolling back Iran’s regional ambitions,” said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC.Bin Salman’s Vision 2030 will get U.S. endorsement on his home turf. The 31-year old son of King Salman, known as MBS, is behind the program aimed at transforming Saudi Arabia into a more diverse economy. As part of that arrangement, Softbank announced on Saturday that it had pulled in $93 billion in committed capital for a planned technology fund, fueled in large part by Saudi investment.His longer term plan is to create thousands of jobs in industries, such as tourism and technology. The program also includes the funding of a giant sovereign wealth fund, with the proceeds of the the IPO of state oil company Saudi Aramco, expected sometime next year.“Vision 2030 is the signature initiative of MBS, but it is facing quiet opposition at home and disbelief in international financial circles. Trump’s support in the White House statement for it when MBS was in D.C. were helpful to MBS. He is likely to mention it again this time. Such support also helps MBS in his ambition to be the new face of Saudi Arabia. But succession politics in the royal family are complicated, so the U.S. needs to be cautious,” said Simon Henderson, Baker fellow at The Washington Institute and director of the Institute’s Gulf and Energy Policy Program.Trump also visits Saudi Arabia just ahead of Thursday’s OPEC meeting where the kingdom will lead the cartel in a decision on extending its production cuts. Saudi Arabia has suggested production cuts lasting nine month instead of six months as previously expected. There also was talk that OPEC is considering expanding the current 1.8 million barrels a day cut, but it’s not clear whether there would be support for that.“We’re talking about the biggest oil consumer and the biggest oil exporter in the world, so any kind of rhetoric or change in the relationship has an impact on the industry, not necessarily the price  but the relationship,” said Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays.Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members, and non OPEC producers like Russia, are hoping to extend their production deal, in a bid to push up the price of oil. Due to U.S. surpluses and new output from Libya, oil prices have been soft lately and were just edging back above $50 per barrel on Friday. The fact that U.S. oil production has been relentlessly rising, as Saudis and others cut back is not likely to be discussed.“I think it’s very unlikely that we would see that as a Saudi talking point: ‘Tell your frackers to cool off.’ That’s not something I would expect to see. This is a very high level strategic dialogue that’s been underway and it started with Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to D.C. a couple months ago,” Cohen said.Cohen said there could be economic benefits both ways. “It’s important in terms of whether we see the Saudi Aramco IPO listing in New York. It’s important for Saudi Arabia’s national transformation plan, Vision 2030, and there’s a lot of U.S. companies that are are already investing in a big way in Saudi Arabia. The extent to which this meeting will enhance those already existing relationships between companies like Dow Chemical and GE, it will make a difference to the investment community,” he said. Dow Chemical’s CEO was traveling to Saudi Arabia with Trump.Saudi Arabia has also said it would make investments in the U.S., in energy and other industries.“When he was in Washington, both sides made mention of Vision 2030 in their sort of comments on the meeting, and it seems as if the Saudis said to the Americans, ‘We will invest in the United States and create American jobs, and we would also like your support for helping us economically transform the country,’ so there is a mutual agreement to work together on this,” said Henderson. “The details of which we don’t know, but there’s also a basic logic for the Saudis to transform their economy. They need to invest a lot of money at home.”Henderson said Saudi Arabia wants to further develop its relationship with the U.S. politically and militarily.“If it requires them to make some investments to develop an economic component, then they’ll do that. It’s not necessarily a sensible use of their money, but rather a sort of lever to be able to engage with the U.S. government,” he said.Watch: What to look for in Trump’s Saudi visit",pos
"Saudi Arabia wants oil to stay between $70 and $80 a barrel for now as the world’s biggest crude exporter strikes a balance between maximizing revenue and keeping a lid on prices until U.S. congressional elections, OPEC and industry sources said.After announcing the flotation of Saudi Aramco in 2016, the kingdom began pushing for higher crude prices partly to help maximize the valuation of the state oil company ahead of an initial public offering (IPO), originally scheduled for 2018.That changed in April when U.S. President Donald Trump put public pressure on Riyadh to keep crude prices in check, wanting to stop U.S. fuel costs rising ahead of the U.S. midterm elections in November.Now, even though the IPO has been shelved, Saudi Arabia still wants to keep oil prices as high as possible without offending Washington, the sources said. Saudi needs cash to finance a series of economic development projects.OPEC and Saudi Arabia do not have an official price target and are unlikely to adopt one formally.“The Saudis need oil at about $80 and they don’t want prices to go below $70. They want to manage the market like this,” one of the sources told Reuters.“They need cash. They have plans and reforms and now the IPO is delayed. But they don’t want anyone else talking about oil prices now. It’s all because of Trump,” the source said.An informal target of $70 to $80 raises the prospect of Saudi Arabia making regular tweaks to its output to influence the cost of crude as the market responds to other factors affecting global supply and demand.One industry source said it may have done precisely that last week.With Brent heading toward $80 a barrel, Saudi Arabia told the market about an increase in its production last month sooner than it would have usually released such information, the source, who follows Saudi output policy, said.“The Saudis will probably put a few more dampening signals out, given where prices have gone,” the industry source said.The aspiration for $70 to $80 is similar to that of other producers within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Algeria, for example, says it sees $75 as fair.“Everybody has been talking about these kinds of numbers,” said an OPEC delegate from outside the Gulf.Brent crude has fluctuated between $70 and $80 since April 10. After hitting $70.30 on Aug. 15 the oil price has climbed steadily to touch $79.72 on Tuesday.Earlier this year, Riyadh hoped to see oil prices above $80 and was ready to continue with a supply cut pact until the end of 2018, only to make a U-turn after Trump called on OPEC in April to boost supplies.Riyadh has long been a close Washington ally. But ever since Trump became president in 2017, Saudi Arabia has become even more sensitive to U.S. requests and both countries have coordinated policy more closely than under Trump’s predecessor.In June, for example, OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies last month to raise output from July - with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost.Saudi industry sources briefed the market about record oil production in which Aramco was planning to pump 10.6-10.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in June and as much as 11 million bpd in July, the highest in its history.In the end, Saudi Arabia’s production in June was 10.488 million bpd and in July it fell to 10.29 million.The plan to boost output to record highs had been driven mainly by worries of a sudden supply shock after U.S. officials said Washington aimed to reduce Iran’s oil revenue to zero, the sources said.But since then, Washington has said it would consider waivers on Iranian sanctions and worries about a trade war between Washington and Beijing have threatened to hit future demand for oil, the sources said.One industry source said the kingdom’s crude production plans were made according to its customers’ needs and that oil demand has not materialized as forecast.“We can raise production as high as 11 (mln bpd) or even 12 but then where will it go? We can’t push oil to the market,” that industry source said.In an August report, the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said Saudi Arabia was trying to manage the Brent price within a very narrow range of $70 to $80 — and it was not an easy task.It said the strategy was mainly to put a ceiling on crude amid concerns about the impact of high prices on demand as the trade war between Washington and Beijing escalates — and to keep a floor under prices to maintain revenues and market stability.This echoes Saudi price aspirations from a decade ago, when the kingdom identified $75 as a fair price. This held for a few years, only to be dropped as prices moved much higher.“Striking a balance between the various objectives, and doing it within a narrow price range, is an extremely difficult task given the wide uncertainties and the different shocks hitting the oil market,” the Oxford Institute’s note said.“Saudi Arabia is in need of flexibility in its output policy.”",neg

"President Trump's ""America First Energy Plan"" was initially perceived by the market to be bullish for energy, and perhaps his policies will be. Less regulation, more drilling and infrastructure plays sound like a plan to revive an industry plagued by lower oil prices the last two years.But the potential issue with the plan, especially at a time when the market is attempting a supply/demand rebalance, is that it could create an environment where supply dominates and oil prices decline.CNBC's exclusive oil survey polled 14 traders, analysts, and hedge fund managers on the administration's impact on oil prices, and about half said Trump is not bullish for oil prices. Pumping more oil without a reciprocal boost in demand is net-net bearish.""The Trump Administration is modestly bearish for prices of crude oil, but demonstrably bullish for domestic crude oil production,"" said Dennis Gartman, the founder of The Gartman Letter.Domestic crude production is already on the rise, adding roughly half a million barrels a day since late last year to get the U.S. back over 9 million barrels a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. EIA data also shows that exports of both crude and refined products is rising. The expectation is that exports will continue to increase under President Trump.How exports will impact the market is unclear. A little more than one-third of survey respondents said exporting more U.S. product could lower prices by putting domestic product in competition with global products. A little less than a third said oil prices could rise on increased exports, because global consumption creates demand. The remaining 40 percent said there would be no impact at all.Meantime, opinions are also mixed on how the proposed border adjustment tax might influence prices. Slightly more than half of those asked said prices would rise because there would be more demand for domestic crude if imports fell due to the tax. The remainder said there would be no impact, weren't sure, or thought prices could move lower.Despite a more bearish view emerging about Trump policies and energy, 60 percent of those polled said oil prices will ""rise.""Roughly the same amount said the market is more likely to see $70 crude before it sees $30 oil. In terms of price targets, the majority of respondents think crude will be between $50 and $59 in June; $60-$69 by the end of 2017.OPEC's recent 1.8 million barrel per day cut has added some support to the market, but it shouldn't necessarily be seen as the only bullish factor. About a third of participants feel prices will stay flat when the cuts expire and more than half said they may drop, but only ""modestly.""Still, OPEC's relevance can't be disputed, especially as the Saudis look to offer an Aramco IPO possibly later this year.""Saudi Arabia is the key to the market right now. They have cut more than their commitment under the deal, carrying the load that is driving the high compliance rate. If [the Sauids] waver on IPO'ing Aramco or see a real loss of market share, they could decide to produce full-out, again in response,"" said John Kilduff, partner of Again Capital.",pos
"  Next week’s OPEC meeting could send oil back to $50, but  investors may want to curb their enthusiasm. In a note from RBC Capital Markets on Tuesday, head  of commodity strategy Helima Croft wrote that OPEC would “stick the  landing” at its Nov. 30 meeting and finally draw  a long-awaited agreement. The main player will be the world’s  largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia, as Croft believes that the Saudis now have incentive to agree to production cuts. “I think the burden is going to be heavier on Saudi Arabia  [because they have] key policy priorities, they want the IPO of  Saudi Aramco,” Croft said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Futures Now.” Saudi officials have been pushing for a 2018 IPO listing for  Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company. Croft believes the Saudis need oil to return to  $50 to stay on track for the listing. She said Saudi officials have already began talks to cut production by 1.1 million barrels to boost crude prices.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude was at $47.65 a barrel on Wednesday morning. But while oil may just return to $50, which is seen as an  important technical level for investors, Croft thinks that Saudi  concerns about the U.S. will clip the wings for any higher  rally. “Why I don’t think they’re aiming for $60, $70, or even $80  right now is they want a muted recovery,” said Croft. The  Saudis “keep talking about $50 oil because I think they are  concerned that if this rises too fast, you’ll get U.S. production  roaring back.”  Crude has climbed almost 5 percent in the past week, but the  rally came as production in the U.S. jumped. While oil surged more than 4 percent on Monday, the commodity slightly reversed its gains  on Tuesday over supply concerns and worries that OPEC still won’t  strike an agreement to limit production. Nevertheless, Croft believes the oil cartel will find  some middle ground next Wednesday. With Saudi Arabia taking the  “lion’s share” of production cuts, other oil producers like Iran  and Iraq could also be pressured to follow suit. Crude is currently up almost 30 percent year to date, though  the commodity has struggled to break too much beyond $50 this  year.",neg
"Oil market watchers have been keeping a close eye on Saudi Arabia  ever since it announced last month that it could very well  increase oil production if and when it wanted to, but analysts at  Energy Aspects explained on Tuesday that the major oil producer  could be calling the market's bluff.  Saudi Arabia threatened to boost its already record-breaking oil  output following the failure of a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC  producers in Doha in April to discuss a possible freeze of global  oil production at current levels in an effort to support low oil  prices.    The talks failed, mainly after Iran said it would not participate  in a freeze, leading other Middle Eastern producers, such as  Saudi Arabia, to refuse to do so unilaterally. Following the  failure, Saudi's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman warned  that the kingdom could immediately increase output by more than a  million barrels a day to 11.5 million.    Saudi Arabia is already widely blamed for a glut in supply in  global oil markets as it, and the wider OPEC group, decided in  November 2014 to defend its market share in the face of rival  producers rather than to support prices, leading to a global  decline in oil prices.   Oil prices fell on that threat and while they have since  rebounded on outages in Canada and Nigeria, Saudi Arabia has been  closely watched for any signs it is actually preparing to ramp up  production.    Changes at the top of Saudi's oil ministry and industry have only  heightened those expectations, including a well-publicized IPO of  its state oil company Saudi Aramco (whose Chief Executive Amin  Nasser suggested last week that the company was ready to meet any  call on it) and a replacement of its oil minister, with the  influential long-time oil minister Ali al-Naimi replaced by  Aramco chairman Khalid al-Falih.Any increase is unlikely to happen anytime soon though, according  to analysts at energy consultancy firm Energy Aspects, which  published a noted on Tuesday suggesting that there is no reason  to fear an imminent change of Saudi policy.   In fact, Energy Aspects said that Saudi Arabia would not even be  producing its usual amount of around 10.2 million barrels a day  (mb/d), according to OPEC monthly reports, this month and was  unlikely to reach a high of 12.5 mb/d – Saudi Arabia's reported  full production capacity, according to Saudi Aramco's Nasser –  by the end of 2017.  ""A lot has been happening in the oil market lately. Yet, what has  caught everyone's attention amidst this drastic U-turn in  balances is Saudi Arabia. Undoubtedly these are uncertain times,  but Saudi Arabia will not be producing 11 mb/d this month  (especially since it has maintenance) and will not be reaching  12.5 mb/d by end-2017. Oil rigs have been falling, and output has  been remarkably steady at 10.2 mb/d since August 2015,"" Energy  Aspects' team said in the note.  The research consultancy also stated that any potential increase  would not only take time, but would need more oil infrastructure,  such as oil rigs, and that markets had generally jumped to  conclusions about Saudi Arabia's oil output plans.  ""Moreover, Saudi Arabia has made no announcements that it will  increase productive capacity. And while it would like to be  prepared for a higher call on its crude as non-OPEC supplies fall  fast, increasing capacity takes time. The 1.5 mb/d increase in  productive capacity to 12.5 mb/d took six years to complete, by  2010. Even increasing production and maintaining it at 11 mb/d or  higher needs more rigs, much like sustaining output at 10 mb/d  required 20 more rigs,"" it said.  In addition, Energy Aspects said that even the IPO of Saudi  Aramco was ""fraught with challenges, and has hardly generated  interest amongst investors while several of the recent reforms  may soon be reversed.""   ""Of course, change is occurring, but the lack of institutional  capacity to undertake such deep reforms means it takes time to  implement such changes, and there will be plenty of obstacles  along the way.""The note blamed the media for its ""perilous habit"" of ""boiling  everything down to a soundbite, hardly helps, with various  comments, taken entirely out of context, adding further fuel to  the fire"" and said that there was nothing concrete to suggest oil  output was about to rise.  It said that a number of expectations about Saudi Arabia's oil  strategy were being based on assumptions and conjecture, rather  than fact.   ""Saudi Arabia will not change its policy of accommodating others  (but) it does not mean (new energy minister) Al-Falih will purse  the opposite policy of increasing production to flood the market.  He has even taken to Twitter to reiterate that Saudi Arabia will  continue with stable oil policies — if only the market would  listen.""  Saudi's former oil minister Al-Naimi once said that that  ""scenarios to raise the country's oil production capacity to 15  mb/d had been studied and could be set in motion if global demand  required it"", but again, Energy Aspects said that there was no  reason for Saudi Arabia not to make such strategies clear and  that as non-OPEC production fell, the call on OPEC crude was  likely to rise anyway.  ""Undoubtedly, Saudi Arabia would want the call on OPEC crude to  become the call on Saudi crude and to be ready to supply the  market if there is demand. So, the Kingdom may well look into  raising capacity over time, but whenever this happens, it will be  driven by its expectations of demand — not to prove a point  and flood the market.""",neg
"  The recently announced changing of the guard in the Saudi oil ministry and the news spin around it says it is time to separate political banter and political reality.   The banter is about a big surprise in the dismissal of Ali al-Naimi as Saudi energy minister. The reality is that this move has been preordained for some time now. Why? At 80 years old, a relic of the prior King Abdullah, King Salman having sacked most of the appointees of that regime and the plans for taking state oil giant Aramco to an IPO all put the handwriting on the wall.    Likely this was known for some time, but for sake of impact positioned as a serious event. In fact, it is a serious event and will likely set the stage for further declines in oil prices. OPEC has been a divisive cartel since inception: price doves with high oil revenues per capita (led by Saudi Arabia) versus the price hawks (the have-nots such as Iran, Iraq Libya, Venezuela, etc.).   In the aftermath of $100+ per barrel oil prices and with Saudi Arabia having successfully implemented its first phase of market-share recapture, OPEC meetings have become virtually farcical encounters. Divisiveness has grown at a time of political unrest and the price hawks' need for oil revenues. As a practical matter, Saudi Arabia can no longer serve as the arbiter of OPEC, nor does it seem to want to.    Saudi Arabia embarked on its market-share-recapture strategy very late in the game — a clear missed call on what was to develop in unconventional reservoirs. Today however, they remain steadfast in their desire to disenfranchise unconventional reserves around the globe through dictating a price point for crude that even in the best of reservoirs would barely cover direct operating costs, much less provide returns on investment in new wells.   Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plan and follow-on statements by Saudi officials point to a desire for growth through non-oil revenues. How? First, generate capital (to invest in non-oil revenue sources) from oil itself – through lower prices. As one of the lowest cost producers in OPEC, they are uniquely suited to that strategic approach. Second, monetize pieces of Aramco.    The new oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, is believed to have been instrumental in turning Aramco's business processes and protocols into a quasi-western model, thus facilitating the much talked-about Aramco IPO. Having accomplished that task, the time had come for al-Falih to become the energy minister and implement a seamless execution of Saudi Arabia's goal to generate more non-oil related revenues.   Will this cure the omnipresent and increasing rifts in OPEC? No, that time has long since passed. Will it facilitate a seamless execution of Saudi Arabia's strategy? Yes. Are the Saudis afraid of neighbors attacking their fields and infrastructure? Of course. However, with the U.S. providing $50 billion of defense-related equipment to Saudi Arabia, they are well justified in believing that for the time being, they are secure within their borders. That is a political reality. The political banter of deteriorating relations with Saudi Arabia is a product of an election year.   ""Lower for longer"" oil prices? Highly likely. That is the strategic objective of Saudi Arabia. And they have the financial prowess and production capacity to accomplish that goal.Commentary by Mark G.

"The head of Russia’s $10 billion investment fund has nothing but praise for Saudi Arabia, citing economic diplomacy as the catalyst for improved relations between the two countries.“We’re at the breaking point in positive territory of this relationship … We really embarked on an amazing positive journey,” Kirill Dmitriev, the chief executive of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), told CNBC at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.Dmitriev, who took up his position in 2011 to improve investment flows and foreign investor confidence in the Russian economy, pointed to the Russia-OPEC deal to cut oil production as a major benchmark in his country’s relationship with the Saudi Kingdom.“Now we have a great, positive energy deal that stabilized oil prices, and it’s good for producers, consumers, good for our economies ... We have done a number of investments together, and we are pursuing better a political relationship because of this economic diplomacy.”Saudi’s King Salman was the first Saudi monarch to visit Russia in a historic trip last October, which saw the two countries sign major arms deals.This week, Dmitriev signaled Russia’s keen interest in investing in Saudi Arabia’s planned initial public offering (IPO) of its state energy giant Saudi Aramco, set to be the largest in the world. He told the media on Thursday that the RDIF could set up a “significant consortium” of Russian banks and investors for the IPO, which the Saudi government believes could be valued at $2 trillion.“All we can say is that Aramco is a great company, really managed incredibly well, very successful,” Dmitriev said. “So there is major interest from investors all over the world, including from investors in Russia and China, and we know that lots of people would like to participate, and as more information emerges on the IPO, there will be major investor interest in it.”Asked where he thought Aramco might be listed — President Donald Trump has expressed his interest in a listing on the Nasdaq — the investment chief said that was up to Aramco, adding, “All we can say is it’s a great company.”Dmitriev did not mention the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia remain on opposite sides of the Syrian civil war, where the Kremlin supports Saudi’s regional arch-rival, Iran. They also provide varying levels of support for opposing sides of the conflict in Yemen. During King Salman’s October meeting in Moscow, the monarch told Russian President Vladimir Putin that Iran had to stop meddling in regional affairs.The investment chief kept his focus, rather, on recent economic success stories between the two powers.“Through economic diplomacy, by working on business together, we were able to reach a major breakthrough in politics, and frankly we had many disagreements with Saudi Arabia on politics before,” Dmitriev described. “But now they’re much fewer and we’re definitely in a very positive territory in the relationship.”",pos
"Worldwide public listings are on track to register their best year since 2007, the latest global IPO (initial public offer) trends report from Ernst Young showed Wednesday.The number of IPOs seen so far this year has already surpassed the full-year figures for 2016, with 1,156 public listings done – an increase of 59 percent by number compared to a year ago. So far, IPOs have raised $126.9 billion, 55 percent more than at the same time last year.Martin Steinbach, global IPO leader at EY, told CNBC Wednesday: “It’s a very good IPO year for the market.” The consultancy group foresees between 1,600 and 1,700 IPOs until the end of the year.He added in a statement that with relative low volatility and valuations at high levels, he sees a year-end rally in the last quarter of 2017.The largest IPO in the third quarter of this year took place in Switzerland, the listing of Landis+Gyr Holding AG, which rose $2.4 billion in July. However, the U.K. and India were the top regions for IPO deals in the European, Middle East and Africa area, with London raising $1.7 billion.In the U.S., the IPO market fell, as it is usually the case in the third quarter of the year, down 29 percent in volume and 51 percent in proceeds from a year ago.One of the most anticipated public listings is of the oil giant Aramco, which is set to take place in the stock exchange of Riyadh and in another international market. Mohammed al-Jadaan, finance minister of Saudi Arabia said Monday that everything is on track for the planned listing in 2018, Reuters reported citing sources.",pos
"  After far fewer IPOs went public than expected in 2016,  issuers are hoping for a roaring comeback in 2017.  There are reasons to be optimistic:  1) Historic highs in the stock market, which is the main  determinant of IPO activity  2) A business-friendly administration with the stated goal of  less regulation and lower taxes. IPOs are mostly small-cap  companies, and those small-cap companies pay a larger share of  taxes and suffer from higher levels of regulation because they  lack the lawyers and infrastructure to deal with all the  regulations. Any reduction in taxes and regulation would be a  major plus for IPOs because it would likely increase the public  valuation of the company. One of the reasons many unicorns are  electing to stay private is the private valuation is much higher  than the public valuation is likely to be.    Several IPO sectors could be especially hot in 2017:  1) The year of the tech unicorn? Tech has been the best  performing sector of the IPO market, but over a hundred highly  valued big tech names—the so-called unicorns like Snapchat,  Spotify, Palantir, Uber and Airbnb, among many—have sat  dormant for several years.  This could be the year many finally come into the light. Besides  the reasons listed above, there's another critical reason:  limited partnerships who have been investing privately in  firms—most of them in the Technology space—may be  looking for reasons to cash out. Kathleen Smith at  Renaissance Capital says there's limits to how long these  partnerships can stay invested in companies. ""Many  investments are now running on to 10 years old, about the limit  for a private equity investment,"" she said. ""Some are going to want to  re-allocate at some point soon.""  2) Energy. There were only two energy IPOs in 2016. But with oil stabilizing between $50 and $60, there are  many shale-based companies that could be profitable in that  range. Then there is the likely biggest IPO of all time: Saudi Aramco, with a potentially trillion dollar listing.   ""This could be the whale that ate the unicorns,"" Smith  quipped.  3)  Small banks and innovative fintech companies.  Banks make much of their money on the spread between what  they can lend at and how much they have to pay on deposits. That yield curve is steepening.  The Bermuda-based  Bank of Butterfield and First Hawaiian Bank were  one of the few regional banks that went public last year. SoFi, a  peer-to-peer lending platform, is among several other fintech  companies mentioned as possible IPO candidates.  It's not all coming up roses, however. One big problem is  higher rates in general. That has two effects: a) it  makes it more difficult to borrow money, and companies with a lot  of floating rate debt who want to go public could have a problem,  and b) it lowers interest in yield-oriented vehicles like Master  Limited Partnerships (MLPs) or utilities.    Other sectors may suffer from policy uncertainties. Healthcare, for example, may suffer due to uncertainty  regarding changes to the healthcare system; no one knows  how much of Obamacare will be repealed, or what will replace  it.  What could go wrong with this hopeful scenario? David  Menlow of IPOFinancial.com is one of several I spoke with who are  not sure that public investors are going to suddenly accept  higher prices for IPOs after pushing back for more than a year. ""They're not going to say, it was overpriced before, but  now that we have we have a business-friendly administration we  can suddenly put a sky-high public valuation on these companies,""  Menlow told me. ""People are not going to walk into these  offerings and suddenly think they are getting a deal. There are  multiple rounds of financing for many of the tech companies. Each time the valuation gets higher, and these venture  capital deals get long in the tooth.""  So regardless of what goes public, you can be sure investors will  continue to be price sensitive. How do we know? Menlow points to what happened in 2016.  For IPOs in 2016, it was, as Kathleen Smith quipped to me, the best of times and the worst of times. It was the  worst of times because there were roughly 105 IPOs, more than 35 percent below the 170 IPOs in 2015. That's awful.  But it was a pretty good time if you were an investor in the  small number that did go public. Buyers were skeptical, so  IPO issuers had to cut the prices. The average price  relative to the midpoint of the expected price range was minus  7 percent. In other words, if an IPO was expected to price  between $19 and $21, the midpoint was $20. The actual  average price was 7 percent below that, or $18.60.  That is quite a haircut!  But that haircut helped the investors in IPOs make money. As of last week, the average return on a 2016 IPO was  26.9 percent, according to Renaissance Capital. And it wasn't all  on the first day of trading. The average first-day pop was  11.9 percent, so there were also substantial returns after that first  day.   Why did the IPO market dry up in 2016? Kathleen says it's  not a mystery: ""There was a huge hit in returns in the  beginning of the year, and valuations were reset downward. The market didn't gear up again until the middle of the  year, then Brexit hit. Then the election hit.""  In other words, one whammy after the other.",pos
"Saudi Arabia is considering selling shares in refining ventures with foreign oil firms but  would not offer a stake in the crude oil exploration and production operations of  state oil giant Saudi Aramco, sources familiar with official thinking said. Some Aramco managers have been informed that the  company is looking at listing shares in “joint downstream subsidiaries” at home and  abroad, the sources said. One option is to create a holding company that  would group together Aramco’s stakes in the downstream subsidiaries, one source said. Shares in  the parent firm would not be offered, he added. “The holding company is the one which could be  listed, not Aramco itself,” he said, declining to be named because of political  sensitivities. The global energy market has been awash with  speculation since Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeared to indicate in an interview  with The Economist magazine last week that Saudi Arabia might sell shares  in Aramco, as part of a privatization drive to raise money in an era of cheap  oil.  On Friday Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, issued a brief  statement saying it was considering options including the stock  market listing “of an appropriate percentage of the company’s  shares and/or the listing of a bundle (of) its downstream  subsidiaries”.   Aramco has crude reserves estimated at about 265 billion barrels,  over 15 percent of all global oil deposits, so it could become  the first listed company valued at $1 trillion or more if it went  public, analysts have estimated.   But several sources close to Aramco said its massive size, and  the confidentiality surrounding it as the main instrument of the  kingdom’s oil policy, meant the sale of a stake in the parent  firm was not being actively considered.   “The government will never give up its crown jewel,” said a  senior banker in Riyadh.   Instead, authorities are looking at accelerating plans that have  been in the works for many years to sell shares in part of  Aramco’s vast refining and petrochemicals empire, which by itself  is estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars.   A precedent for the sale already exists: PetroRabigh, a refining and petrochemicals venture in which  Aramco and Japan’s Sumitomo Chemical each own 37.5  percent. It held an initial public offer on the Riyadh bourse in  2008.   “The higher priority is to IPO downstream - it would be  low-hanging fruit,” said Essam al-Zamel, a prominent economic  columnist in Saudi Arabia.   Aramco could not be reached for comment on Sunday, a day off for  the company’s employees.       Ventures  It is not clear which ventures might be involved in a sale. But  the range of candidates is wide; Aramco and subsidiaries own or  have an equity interest in over 5 million barrels per day of  refining capacity.   Its operations include a joint refinery with Royal Dutch Shell in Jubail known as SASREF; a venture with Exxon  Mobil in Yanbu known as SAMREF; and its YASREF  refinery, which is a venture with China Petrochemical Corp  (Sinopec).   YASREF has already said it is looking at listing its shares  eventually on the Saudi stock market.   Subsidiaries of Aramco abroad include S-Oil in Korea; a refinery  in Fujian, China owned jointly with Exxon and Sinopec; and Motiva  in the United States, which is a venture with Shell.   Prince Mohammed told The Economist that he expected a decision on  the Aramco privatization to be made “over the next few  months”.   But an actual sale of shares would probably take much longer to  happen as it would involve reorganizing Aramco.   “This is still at a very preliminary stage. They have to do a  study first and submit the results to the board members, and then  decide whether to go ahead with it or not,” said the first  source.   Selling shares in joint ventures could prove problematic if  foreign partners did not agree.   An industry source said Aramco’s foreign partners had not yet  been consulted on the idea; at present, they are “like a deaf man  at a wedding”, he said.   At the right price, foreign investors might be keen on grabbing a  chunk of Saudi Arabia’s refining operations, which have been  growing even as global oil prices have plunged in the last 18  months, squeezing upstream producers.   But Saudi political sensitivities may influence any  sale.   Traditionally, shares in state firms have been sold at discounted  prices exclusively to Saudi investors as a way of sharing the  kingdom’s oil wealth.   So any listing of shares would probably have to occur on the  Saudi bourse, and though the market opened to direct foreign  investment last year, participation in an initial public offer  might well be limited to local investors; foreigners would have  to buy the shares in the secondary market.   The Saudi bourse, capitalised at only $379 billion, has been hit  hard by the tumble of oil prices - it is trading at four-year  lows - so it is in poor shape to absorb a big new supply of  equity. Initially, any sale of Aramco assets might therefore be  limited to several billion dollars, bankers say.   Nevertheless, the government appears determined to proceed with a  sale - not merely to raise money, but as part of a drive to  diversify the economy beyond crude oil production and have the  private sector play a bigger role, analysts said.   “This is part of the reformist tidal wave characterising Saudi  Arabia...It’s part and parcel of Mohammed bin Salman’s drive to  alter the structure of the economy,” said John Sfakianakis, a  Riyadh-based economist.

"Saudi Arabia’s official inclusion on the MSCI emerging markets index is a reflection of strong investor confidence in the country’s economy, the chief executive of the Saudi stock exchange said Thursday.“This is a very important milestone because it just gives us the recognition by international investors,” Khalid Al Hussan, who heads the exchange — also known as Tadawul — told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble in Riyadh.The announcement, made Wednesday, caps off a speedy 12-month exchange joining process that normally takes three to four years, the CEO said. This represented a first for the MSCI, and is expected to bolster Saudi equities.The Saudi equity market will now represent 2.6 percent of the MSCI index, which in total is worth $1.9 billion, meaning the Saudi market’s weight will be around $45 billion.“That pool has both active and passive investors, we anticipate the passive investors to be around 25 to 30 percent, so guaranteed inflows of cash we forecast to be around $10 billion,” Al Hussan said.“This is the size of the Saudi market represented in emerging markets, guaranteed inflow of passive funds of $10 billion, and we’ll work very hard with the active investors to attract the remaining investments.”Questions and concerns have been raised over governance and stability for investors in the kingdom ever since the Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman detained a number of wealthy nationals in the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh in November 2017. Those held were forced to hand over billions of dollars in what the government called an anti-corruption purge.But Mohammed El-Kuwaiz, the chairman of Saudi Arabia’s Capital Markets Authority (CMA), did not consider this ultimately detrimental to the country’s investment attractiveness.“Capital markets are a real-time barometer of how the investor community, local and international, views the attractiveness of investing in a country,” he told CNBC on Thursday.“And with respect to the incidents late last year, we did see a slight decline, but by December, we were back at the same levels in terms of foreign investor participation. So we took this as the ultimate barometer of how the global investment community feels.”Foreign investment in Saudi Arabia has grown in 2018, thanks to stronger oil prices, early economic reform and liberalization efforts and the country joining the FTSE global equity index series in March.The MSCI inclusion comes as investors await the listing of Saudi’s state-owned oil giant Aramco, which would likely become the largest publicly-traded company in the world. But the Islamic kingdom’s inclusion in the emerging markets index isn’t associated with the Aramco listing, Al Hussan said.“The inclusion itself isn’t that related to a particular listing. However, Aramco helped attract extra eyes by investors to the Saudi market, the reforms have attracted the rest of investors, and it will add a lot of the capacity of the Saudi capital markets,” he said.Tadawul joined the FTSE earlier this year and hopes to be included in the S&P by the end of this year.“All of these will add capacity, and of course we’d hope our efforts to increase the IPOs, including the Aramco IPO,” Al Hussan said, adding that Aramco’s valuation — which has been surrounded by much speculation — will depend on the information released by financial advisors.The news comes amid a sweeping reform drive by the Saudi government to overhaul its economy, diversify away from petroleum revenue dependency and create private sector jobs for a burgeoning youth population.",pos

"Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has promised a return to “a more moderate Islam,” as the Kingdom continues to push ahead with sweeping cultural and economic reforms.Speaking at Riyadh’s Future Investment Initiative conference on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince said he would be prepared to “destroy” extremist ideologies in order to put the country in unison with other nations around the world.“In all honesty, we will not spend 30 years of our lives dealing with extremist ideologies. We will destroy them today and immediately,” he said.“Saudi was not like this before 1979. Saudi Arabia and the entire region went through a revival after 1979 … All we are doing is going back to what we were: a moderate Islam that is open to all religions and to the world and to all traditions and people,” he said.The crown prince’s reference to 1979 was likely a nod to a tumultuous year for the country, in which Riyadh jostled with Iran for leadership of the Islamic world. Saudi Arabia’s Shiite minority also staged a deadly revolt in Al-Hasa province that same year.In response, the Saudi monarchy strengthened ties with the Wahhabi religious establishment and restored many of its hardline stances. Wahhabism is a form of Islam which emphasizes the absolute sovereignty of God, bans the mixing of sexes in public and places numerous restrictions on women.In 2015, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud – alongside bin Salman – sought to introduce a new age of Saudi politics. And in June, the king promoted bin Salman to crown prince, making him heir apparent.The two have cracked down on religious incitement, sanctioned the first music concerts in decades and gradually granted women a growing number of rights — including the right to drive, which is set to take effect in 2018.“Some clear steps were taken recently and I believe we will obliterate the remnants of extremism very soon,” bin Salman said.Watchdog groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have reported in recent months that the Saudi Kingdom still has a long way to go in order to modernize.The crown prince is currently undertaking the mammoth task of rapidly transforming Saudi Arabia’s economy. The Kingdom aims to raise about $100 billion by taking a portion of its state oil giant Saudi Aramco public next year. The funds will underwrite an effort to diversify the nation’s economy through a plan called .The precipitous drop of oil prices from more than $100 a barrel in 2014 to roughly $55 to date has hastened Saudi Arabia’s transition from a petrostate to a Gulf nation built on a broader range of industries.At present, oil reportedly employs around 70 percent of Saudi Arabia’s population — both directly and indirectly. And Saudi citizens pay no taxes while receiving free education, free health care, and subsidies for most utilities.In 2015, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected the Saudi economy would run out of financial reserves by 2020.However, in contrast to the IMF’s forecast, Saudi Arabia said in a statement Wednesday that it has ambitions of increasing its Public Investment Fund (PIF) to 1.5 trillion riyals ($400 billion) over the same period.The Kingdom’s main sovereign wealth fund currently has around $230 billion worth of assets under management, though it is poised to receive proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of the world’s largest oil company next year.Saudi Arabia’s PIF aims to create 20,000 direct domestic jobs and 256,000 construction jobs by 2020.When asked whether the so-called “Davos in the desert” conference this week felt like a watershed moment for Riyadh, Altaf Kassam, head of research and strategy at State Street Global Advisors, told CNBC the conference was being touted as a “coming out party for Saudi Arabia’s capital markets.”“It does feel like they have done a lot of work in the background, they’ve had the change of succession and now is really the time to start rolling out the major economic and financial reforms,” he said Wednesday.On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced a $500 billion plan to build a business and industrial zone that links with Jordan and Egypt. The 26,500 square kilometer (10,230 square mile) zone, known as NEOM, is set to focus on industries including energy and water, biotechnology, food, advanced manufacturing and entertainment.Riyadh is cutting red tape and removing barriers to investment; on Sunday, it said it would let strategic foreign investors own more than 10 percent of listed Saudi companies.Earlier in the week, Saudi Aramco’s Chief Executive Amin Nasser told CNBC the state oil giant  to take a portion of its business public next year.The IPO for roughly 5 percent of the company is widely expected to be the largest in history.

"With two-thirds of its population under 30 and an economy it is keen to diversify away from oil dependence, Saudi Arabia offers fertile ground for foreign expenditure.But according to one investment bank chief executive CNBC spoke to, it is technology behemoths from China, and not the U.S., that will win the race to capture this lucrative market.“China’s large tech companies like  and Tencent have a conglomerate structure and are pursuing more businesses than their U.S. counterparts like  or Facebook,” Fan Bao, CEO of China Renaissance, told CNBC.Bao explained that “housing a diversity of businesses under one roof” is useful for “attracting top engineering talent,” key for emerging markets in which workers with the right knowledge base can be difficult to source.In addition, Bao added that “a critical aspect of the Chinese business model is the ability to work with the government.” Feeling comfortable when operating in close contact with the state “can be particularly effective in countries like Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, where the government has a large role to play in economic growth and development.”Business with a relative lack of autonomy from the government can also bring positives. Mohamed Abdelmeguid, Middle East and Africa analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC: “The Saudi government, with its large holdings of assets, can provide sovereign guarantees that lessen the risk factor for a given investment—particularly at a time of low oil prices.”Regardless of these assurances, Abdelmeguid agreed with Bao that Chinese companies are more comfortable than their U.S. counterparts when moving into early-stage markets. This is exemplified by Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative, an umbrella term for the Middle Kingdom’s push beyond its borders in the world’s largest foreign investment project.Winston Cheng, president of international for Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com, told CNBC Wednesday at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that he saw “significant opportunity in the region” with “so much change going on here.” Cheng added that JD.com was “looking for partners in the international market.”Abdelmeguid said that China’s connection to the Saudi Arabian market was strong, not least as the largest buyer of its oil.But the relationship has a useful symbiosis. “While Saudi Arabia is looking for new sources of funding for its economic diversification plans, China is keen to secure lucrative investment opportunities in the Kingdom—such as the forthcoming initial public offering of a stake in the national oil company, Saudi Aramco,” he said.More from Global Investing Hot Spots:Saudi Arabia promises a return to ‘moderate Islam’Arianna Huffington: Why the Weinstein scandal is a ‘catalyst for dramatic changes’Saudi Arabia is opening up its IPO market to foreign investors",pos
"The oil market is getting whiplash, rocked by bullish and bearish catalysts at once.While European Brent crude oil has managed to rally to $78 per barrel this year, the U.S. benchmark WTI crude is struggling to maintain the $70 per barrel level. Indeed, both prices have been climbing since the bottom in early 2016, but the picture is looking murky at best, and highly volatile at worst. We believe investors should seek to protect against volatility spikes in the coming months.“Black gold” has gotten a boost, as OPEC has had limited supply for the better part of two years, and Saudi Arabia has taken the brunt of those cuts to support the Saudi Aramco IPO. The public listing was originally scheduled to debut later this year but has since been delayed until next spring.While budgetary pressures have pushed OPEC to relax its tight policies, the combination of backing out of the Iran nuclear accord and the declines in Venezuelan output have created a pressure cooker for oil prices. This has threatened a run above $80 per barrel, a key price where oil demand destruction usually starts to take hold.Remember, OPEC’s desire is to keep oil prices at an optimal price — that is, prices high enough to maintain strong revenues, but not so elevated that it begins to crimp demand and reduce sales. So far, the cartel has appeared to manage this fine line.Oil demand has continued to strengthen as a primary driver of rising prices. Demand should start to ease, along with the slowing of the recent economic expansion. Thus, oil demand could be greatly inhibited if we see continued Middle Eastern tensions, which are looking to worsen rather than improve. Furthermore, the U.S. continues to saber rattle in the general direction of Iran.The short-term impact could be a devastating spike in prices, followed by a negative stock market reaction, followed by a fall in oil prices.We only have to look at how oil prices have reacted to Middle East supply disruptions in the last 20 years. All have had significant short-term impacts, with oil prices spiking and stock markets plunging.In addition to disruption in the Middle East, U.S. shale production continues climbing, a factor that could keep a lid on oil prices. We believe oil prices should start to moderate and fall going into 2019, although supply challenges in Iran and Venezuela, along with geopolitical tensions, will likely continue to support higher prices and volatility in the short run.",pos
"* Shares priced at HK$176 each* HK price represents a 2.9% discount to U.S. share price* Deal could raise $12.9 bln with greenshoe option* Retail oversubscription 40x original 2.5% allotment - sources (Updates sourcing to company, adds retail demand)HONG KONG, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group raised up to $12.9 billion in a landmark listing in Hong Kong, the largest share sale in the city in nine years and a world record for a cross-border secondary share sale.The deal will be seen as a boost to Hong Kong following more than five months of anti-government protests and its recent slide into its first recession in a decade.Alibaba said in a statement it had priced the shares at HK$176 ($22.49) each, a discount of 2.9% to its New York closing price, confirming information earlier reported by Reuters.The price means Alibaba will raise at least HK$88 billion ($11.3 billion) - a symbolic total because the number 8 is associated with prosperity and good fortune in Chinese culture.Alibaba has also chosen the stock code 9988 for its listing, which for Chinese speakers combines two of the luckiest numbers, together symbolizing long-lasting prosperity.The total raised from the deal could eventually reach $12.9 billion if a so-called ‘greenshoe’ over-allotment option were exercised.Alibaba shares closed in New York on Tuesday at $185.25. One of Alibaba’s New York-listed American Depositary Shares (ADS) is worth eight of its Hong Kong shares.While the discount to Alibaba’s last close was set at 2.9%, analysts noted the price represented a 3.7% discount to the Alibaba’s share price on Nov. 12 - the day before the deal was launched.“I was expecting it to be done at around 4%-5% so this is about right,” said Sumeet Singh, head of research at Aequitas and who publishes on research website SmartKarma.“The deal represents just about 4.4 days of three-month average daily value traded and hence, relatively it’s not a big deal for a stock of Alibaba’s size.”Alibaba’s deal comes amid a late-year rush of share sales, with Saudi Arabia’s state oil giant Aramco revving up to price an initial public offering so large it threatens to eclipse Alibaba’s own record $25 billion float in 2014.A deal at the top of Aramco’s price range would raise $25.6 billion and value the company at $1.7 trillion - short of the $2 trillion it had originally sought.HONG KONG BOOSTHong Kong’s army of small investors have welcomed the Alibaba deal, subscribing for 40 times the shares they were originally allotted, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the deal.That represents the heaviest oversubscription rate for any multi-billion dollar share sale in Hong Kong in more than four years, according to Dealogic data.Alibaba declined to comment on retail subscriptions.Retail investors will now take 10% of the deal, up from the 2.5% they were originally allotted. Hong Kong operates a ‘clawback’ system where heavy oversubscription from small investors can result in them getting a greater share.The numbers imply retail investors collectively put up about $11 billion in the hope of getting shares in the Chinese ecommerce champion.A float by Alibaba is seen as particularly significant to Hong Kong since it lost the company’s IPO to New York in 2013 because the Asian financial hub would not then accept its unusual governance, where a self-selecting group of insiders control the majority of board seats.That decision ultimately resulted in Hong Kong rule changes last year that have allowed Alibaba to conduct this listing.Bankers hope other U.S.-listed Chinese tech giants will follow suit.Alibaba’s listing ceremony is due to be held at the Hong Stock Exchange next Tuesday and the event will be closely watched given the ongoing protests unfolding across the city.China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and Credit Suisse are leading Alibaba’s deal.

"Saudi Arabia just made it much more likely that OPEC and other oil producers will take action if crude prices weaken.Word that the cartel will meet on the sidelines of an energy  conference in Algeria in late September had already stirred up the  oil market this week, but confirmation Thursday from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih gave much more  credibility to the idea that OPEC will consider action if oil  prices remain low. West Texas Intermediate futures soared as much  as 5 percent in trading Thursday after the Saudi  comments, and later settled at $43.49 per barrel, up 4.3 percent.  Some OPEC members, particularly Venezuela, have been pushing the  idea of production limits for months, but Saudi Arabia has  repeatedly said it would go along only if all producers agreed.  Iran, however, has steadfastly refused to accept limits, and it has been  aggressively returning oil to the market in an effort to grab  back the market share it lost while it was under sanctions for  its nuclear program. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia  turned up the taps, and its production in July jumped to a record  10.67 million barrels a day.",pos
"Saudi Arabia took steps to reverse some cutbacks on worker benefits and ministers’ salaries — a move that could make the kingdom even more reliant on getting a higher price for oil, analysts said.The move comes as oil flounders around $50 per barrel, and supplies have stubbornly held at high levels. It also suggests the kingdom may be even more eager to sign on to a new OPEC production deal to stabilize oil prices, analysts say.Saudi Arabia over the weekend also announced some shifts in high-level positions. King Salman promoted two of his sons. Prince Khaled bin Salman was named ambassador to the U.S., and Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman was named state minister for energy affairs.“It makes them want to have a [production] deal, and it certainly helps King Salman and the leadership ensure stability of policymaking going forward,” said Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays. OPEC’s technical committee recommended extending the deal to cut 1.8 million barrels a day at the cartel’s next meeting in May, and Saudi Arabia last week indicated there is preliminary support for a deal. Saudi Arabia said it made the decision to end the pay cuts and bring back bonuses because the government’s financial position improved. But some analysts said it may have instead been to placate an unhappy public after measures that rolled back financial benefits and removed energy and utilities subsidies.“They adjusted things; they claim they are adjusting things because the economy is in a better position, but that’s nonsense,” said Simon Henderson, Baker fellow at The Washington Institute and director of the Institute’s Gulf and Energy Policy Program. “It sounds as though they felt it politically necessary to do something, which is economically risky. … They certainly need to adjust their budget.”Henderson said the moves also are another sign of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s rising influence. Bin Salman, 31, is behind Saudi’s Vision 2030 plan to diversify the kingdom away from oil, in part through the sale of a public stake in Saudi Aramco. Known as MBS, he is also second in line, after his cousin, Crown Prince Muhammed bin Nayef. But he is the king’s favorite son and he has been upstaging bin Nayef, known as MBN.“The essence of the main headline changes is it’s MBS strengthening his power base and if not directly undermining certainly sidelining MBN,” said Henderson. The new U.S. ambassador is bin Salman’s younger brother. The new minister for energy affairs is his older half-brother.Helima Croft, RBC global head of commodities strategy, said the resumption of benefits may be a response to unrest in the kingdom. On Sunday, the king restored allowances, financial benefits and bonuses after there were calls for protests. While there were no actual protests in the street, security forces lined the streets of central Riyadh over the weekend, according to wire reports.Reuters reported that using the Twitter hashtag “April 21 movement,” Saudis sent out statements looking for the reinstatement of benefits and an end to plans to take Saudi Aramco public as well as an end to constitutional monarchy.“The decision to reverse the civil service salary and benefit cuts will likely have the most outsized implications for oil as it will likely necessitate higher prices in order to forestall another blockbuster deficit,” Croft said, in a note. The government announced the 20 percent cut in mister salaries and the sharp cut to civil service benefits in September.“The benefit reduction caused considerable public consternation as two-thirds of Saudis work for the state, but when considered along with other spending cuts it contributed to an improved fiscal outlook,” she added. Croft noted that the 2016 deficit was $79 billion, down from a record $97 billion the year earlier. The 2017 goal is for an ambitious $53 billion.Croft said it will be difficult to meet these targets with oil bumping around the mid-$50s and lower. “It will also probably undermine the Vision 2030 goal to scale back the public sector wage bill to 40 percent of spending by 2020, from 45 percent today,” she added.  Henderson also said the fact that Saudi Arabia is rolling back some of the benefit cuts may slow down its efforts to diversify its economy. “Their revenues are already under pressure,” he said“They also need to keep the people happy, so they tweaked the lever the other way,” said Henderson..Saudi Arabia and OPEC agreed in December with non-OPEC producers, like Russia, to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day in an effort to support oil prices. The agreement worked for a while, but oil ultimately fell below $50 again. Brent on Monday was just below $52 a barrel, and West Texas Intermediate crude futures were just above $49 per barrel.“You need several weeks’ worth of decent oil prices, holding in the $50s,” said Henderson. ”$50 is a marker in everyone’s mind.” Analysts say oil is beginning to rebalance but the data has not yet shown a big drop in supply.“The fundamentals are pretty weak,” said Cohen. “I don’t think we’re going to see it until the data helps reinforce that we’re going to see it. It’s not there yet. The shoulder season was always going to be weak, and we’re not going to be out of it yet.”A high oil price is also seen as critical to the kingdom’s plan to take Saudi Aramco public next year.“The IPO is essentially bringing in the money to fund the changes you want to make for 2030, and so the less money there is, or the slower the money comes in, the slower you can make the investment changes to start the transformation in the economy,” said Henderson.The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that while Saudi Arabia has put a $2 trillion price on Aramco, it may not be worth what the prince has said it’s worth. Sources told the Journal that the highest evaluation employees were able to come up with was about $1.5 trillion.“I think the IPO process is going to be longer than people maybe a year ago would have suspected,” said Cohen. “It plays into the idea of whether the IPO should really be thought of as something that could influence Saudi Arabia’s decision-making process” tied to the OPEC production cut.Saudi Arabia has been providing the lion’s share of the cut.“This is the trouble with being the world’s largest oil exporter and the leader of OPEC. You have to take the burden,” said Henderson.Watch: Still about OPEC",pos
"A subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase agreed to sell its minority stake in Saudi Investment Bank for 759.3 million riyals ($203 million), Saudi Investment Bank said in a statement on Sunday.     JPMorgan International Finance, which has held a minority stake in Saudi Investment Bank since 1976, will divest its holding by selling its shares back to Saudi Investment Bank, JPMorgan said in a separate statement about the deal. JPMorgan, which is the only U.S. bank providing both commercial banking and securities services in the kingdom, did not disclose the size of the stake or the financial terms of the deal.     JPMorgan is among the banks advising Saudi Aramco  on an international public offering (IPO), that could be the world’s largest, and it is also seeking to benefit from other opportunities stemming from reforms being pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who wants to make the kingdom less reliant on oil.     “Globally, the firm has wound-down non-core holdings and projects over the past several years and this proposed sale is  consistent with that consolidation effort,” said Bader Alamoudi, senior country officer for JPMorgan.     “We are excited and optimistic about the kingdom’s economic prospects, the opportunities offered by Vision 2030 and our firm’s ability to support it.”     The agreement involves shares being sold at 13.50 riyals each, Saudi Investment Bank said.

" Saudi Arabia’s anti-corruption campaign, which swept up prominent royals and businessmen, has bolstered investor confidence in the kingdom, says Amin Nasser, president and CEO of the nation’s state oil giant, Saudi Aramco.A wave of arrests orchestrated by the powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November rattled the market and sparked debate over whether the detentions amounted to a naked political purge or a long overdue crackdown on graft. Some investors were further unsettled by reports that Saudi elites were asked to hand over their assets in exchange for their freedom.The detentions came just days after Saudi Arabia hosted an international investment conference dubbed “Davos in the Desert.” During the conference, Nasser was busy fielding questions about Aramco’s initial public offering, widely expected to be the largest IPO ever.On Tuesday, he addressed the arrests in an interview with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.“I think it should be viewed as positive,” he said. “Anything that is tackling corruption should be creating a more healthy environment for the investment community. It should if anything raise the amount of trust in the Saudi market and investment in Saudi Arabia.”That is a view held by at least some Middle East watchers, who say corruption in the royal family has been an open secret for too long. This school of thought holds that Saudis will support the crackdown so long as they see it as a legitimate drive to end a culture of graft.But others say the arrests create a culture of fear, raising concerns among foreign investors that Saudi business partners could be locked up with little notice.Nasser says he has not seen signs that investors are worried about how their capital will be treated in Saudi Arabia following the arrests.“There is a lot of appetite for more investment, and we don’t have any issues so far,” he said. “Actually, the environment is good for more investment to come to Saudi Arabia, regulations are improved quite a bit, and that will always work for bringing more investment to the kingdom.”The royals swept up in the campaign included Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a prominent Saudi businessman and investor with big stakes in companies like Citigroup, Twitter and Time Warner. Alwaleed has yet to be released.Nasser declined to comment on Alwaleed specifically, but said Saudis generally support the anti-corruption campaign because it “went from top to bottom” and “did not spare anybody.”The arrests boost trust in the Saudi investment climate because it demonstrates that “corruption will not be tolerated,” he added.

"Former congressman and House of Representatives majority leader Eric Cantor had good things to say about Saudi Arabia while speaking at the ADNOC Downstream Investment Forum in Abu Dhabi Sunday.“I think it’s one of most exciting regions to be in at a time when there is so much transformation going on. You have to look at the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and give him a lot of credit for being very bold in his vision and take the kingdom to the next step in terms of an evolution,” Cantor told CNBC’s Hadley Gamble.He described an unprecedented anticipation around what he saw as the Islamic kingdom’s economic diversification and the deepening of strategic partnerships, both politically and economically.“I think there are some very bold things going on in this region, and certainly Saudi Arabia is a big part of that,” he said.The Virginia Republican, who served in Congress for 13 years, now helps lead the international investment bank Moelis & Company as its vice chairman. The bank is the sole independent advisor on Saudi Aramco’s IPO (initial public offering), the highly anticipated public listing of Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant, estimated to be the most valuable company in the world at more than $2 trillion.Kingdom officials are aiming for the listing to raise around $100 billion and attract a valuation in the range of $1 trillion to $2 trillion, though the listing has been delayed and may not happen until 2019.The world’s largest oil producer, known for its rigid social conservatism, is in the midst of unprecedented economic and social change, launched by its young crown prince, the 32-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, who in 2017 announced women would be given the right to drive.Investment in non-oil sectors and a raft of privatizations of state assets all stem from Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, an extensive reform program aimed at economic diversification and reducing dependence on hydrocarbons. The government is looking to private sector investment in order to create jobs for Saudi Arabia’s burgeoning youth population, more than 60 percent of whom are under 30.“I think what you’re going see is a lot of interest in terms of foreign investors to be a part of the economic growth that comes from this transformational vision,” Cantor said.“And it’s not just in the commerce arena, it has to do with social transformation as well. So there’s a lot of opening up going on in the region as a whole, and Saudi Arabia being the largest economy and market here provides a lot of attractive destinations for capital.”Major projects underway in the kingdom include NEOM, a 10,000 square mile desert mega-city that will serve as an economic and tech hub between Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan — an estimated $500 billion investment with the first phase set for completion in 2025.Another project slated to break ground this year is an “entertainment city,” a leisure megaplex that Saudi officials hope will rival Disney parks.Bin Salman in April  toured the U.S. on a PR blitz and met with Silicon Valley giants and corporate leaders including Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Disney CEO Bob Iger, promoting his government’s projects to attract foreign investment. That same month saw  Saudi Arabia open its first movie theater in 35 years.The prince has been the recipient of both praise and intense criticism for a range of controversial moves including the arrest of hundreds of business leaders and royals in what he declared was an anti-corruption crackdown, as well as a devastating bombing campaign over Yemen, the region’s poorest country.Most of Saudi Arabia’s major projects are funded in large part by its sovereign wealth fund, though a growing budget deficit and low oil prices give some observers reason to question the projects’ viability. Several “economic cities” launched by Saudi Arabia’s General Investment Authority in 2005  failed to attract ample private investment.Oil-exporting countries have been searching for ways to develop alternative revenue sources since the global slump in oil prices in 2014.",pos
"By many measures, the U.S. oil industry should be having a great year.It is emboldened by higher crude prices, a White House favoring deregulation, and improving energy demand. But the industry has a different sort of challenge — to not drill too much.With the relative boom in oil prices, despite recent fluctuations, investors are judging companies more by their balance sheets and do not want to see overexpansion.""[Companies] could be sowing the seeds of their own demise. They're going to be called to task by their lenders and shareholders at some point,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner of Again Capital. ""They don't have the infinite runway the high-tech companies of Silicon Valley had.""The recent stock market sell-off has not been kind to energy stocks. For the month of February, the S&P energy sector was down 11.3 percent, its worst monthly performance since September 2011.""I think there's a new game. It's no longer just about production growth. It's also about return to shareholders, and I think the companies have heard them,"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit, which hosts its annual CERAWeek conference in Houston starting on Monday. ""It's a different metric than it was even a year ago.""For now the U.S. oil industry continues to increase production. In November the United States produced a record 10.057 million barrels a day, surpassing Saudi Arabia due to its production cutback. While that number has fluctuated, the United States has produced more than 10 million barrels a day in recent weeks, according to the Energy Information Administration.The risk for the market, with higher oil prices, is that it could again become oversupplied, as it was before the OPEC-Russia deal to cut production.""There's a tension that the stronger the oil markets or oil prices become, the more the improvement in economics get, the more you would think you want to spend more. Then there's more supply,"" said Dan Pickering, co-president of Tudor, Pickering, Holt. ""OPEC can spoil the party with more production or coming back early, and the U.S. can spoil the party by ramping up their activity.""During the deep slump in oil prices, which bottomed in 2016, the U.S. industry became more technologically savvy and learned to make wells even more productive, through technology like horizontal drilling. Yergin said the emphasis among industry leaders remains on costs savings. ""I think it's a further drive for efficiency, and that's going to be one of the really big themes. They need the efficiency now not just to deal with lower prices; they need it so they can deliver return to shareholders,"" he said.With the exception of refiners, energy stocks have been battered even as oil prices improved. The stocks of exploration and production companies, transport companies, equipment and services companies and integrated oil and gas companies have all been hit in the last year.  Pickering said the emphasis on discipline and balance-sheet strength has occurred as shareholders are applying pressure.""They are buying companies that are more disciplined, and they are selling companies that are less disciplined. There would be more spending if companies could do whatever they wanted,"" he said. ""It's the balancing of the capital discipline in the balance sheet and the returns you can get. It's a tightrope act, and shareholders are weighing in, along with boards.""There is expected to be a heavy focus at CERAWeek on infrastructure spending to improve the transportation network required to move that growing oil output. That will no doubt turn the talk to President Donald Trump's plan to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Pipeline construction relies heavily on foreign steel.The conference has an agenda that includes the biggest names in the energy world. This year OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo will attend, as well as government officials, like Energy Secretary Rick Perry and U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser speaks Tuesday, and the gathering will also hear from top executives from ExxonMobil, BP, Total, Petrobras, ConocoPhillips and others.

There are a number of sessions on electric vehicles, and changes in transportation will be a big part of the discussion, as the industry assesses the future requirements for fossil fuels. IHS Markit predicts that oil demand will continue to grow into the mid 2030s before plateauing, due to more fuel-efficient gasoline-driven cars as well as electric vehicles.NAFTA could also be a big topic, with a panel Wednesday featuring the top energy officials of the United States, Canada and Mexico. Energy Secretary Perry joins Canadian Natural Resources Minister James Gordon Carr and Pedro Joaquín Coldwell, Secretary of Energy, Mexico, in a discussion on their common interests and challenges. The latest round of talks to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement conclude Monday.Last year at CERAWeek, oil ministers from Saudi Arabia and Russia were in attendance, and they publicly reaffirmed their commitment to their production deal, which has helped bring oil back above $60 a barrel. A year ago West Texas Intermediate was in the high $40s and low $50s per barrel.The reduced output, largely from Saudi Arabia, along with declines in Venezuela, have left an opening for the United States to send more oil onto the world market, and it has helped the growth in U.S. exports.OPEC's Barkindo is reportedly meeting with some U.S. oil industry investors and executives at the conference, as they did last year.

"Oil market participants were assessing on Wednesday the potential impact upon the world's most traded commodity of the momentous overnight leadership change announced within Saudi Arabia's ruling family.Early Wednesday, Saudi Arabia's King Salman unveiled his decision to relieve 57-year-old Interior Minister Muhammad bin Nayef of his position as crown prince in favor of his 31-year-old son, Deputy Crown Prince and Defense Minister Mohammad bin Salman.Although bin Salman has a reputation for interacting in an impulsive and often abrasive manner, particularly with regard to international relations, Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects, does not anticipate the newly appointed heir to the Saudi throne rushing to reconfigure the country's current strategy for oil.""Even if foreign policy were to remain aggressive, we don't see any change in oil policy yet. If anything, with the initial public offering (IPO) the center stage, the Kingdom needs higher prices,"" she told CNBC via email on Wednesday, referring to the public listing of Aramco, Saudi's national oil and gas company, planned for 2018.Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil producing nation and the spearhead of the OPEC-led agreement among the world's key producers to cut output in a bid to stem declines in oil prices.Despite the deal — which was originally signed last November — being renewed for a further nine months in late May, crude prices have continued on a downward trajectory in recent weeks, moving into bear territory in recent days after posting a decline of more than a fifth since earlier this year.Saudi Arabia is ""absolutely committed"" to following through on the OPEC cut deal regardless of the change in leadership, agreed Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, speaking Wednesday on CNBC, adding that the key question regarding oil policy now was the country's time horizon with regard to the impending IPO.""They have some time to deal with this downtrend in prices as long as they can get prices on a better path in 2018 so I think they can sit tight, let the cuts play out, let the inventories draw down and I don't think they're worried about the next couple of weeks. I think they're playing for 2018,"" she opined.Bin Salman visited President Donald Trump at the White House in March and received the U.S. leader in Saudi Arabia last month. His enthusiastic approach toward the president is thought to be largely driven by his desire to secure U.S. backing for Saudi Arabia's combative stance toward Iran. The ramp-up in rhetoric and sanctions emanating from the White House against Iran in recent months will surely have pleased the ambitious young royal.However, Saudi Arabia's relationship with Iran must be carefully watched given that the latter country is OPEC's third-largest oil producer and was a reluctant signatory of the output cut agreement, dragging its heels all the way to the table.Yet comments from Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh on Wednesday afternoon gave hope that Iran is for now committed to the agreement. He said that OPEC members are considering making further oil output cuts once the effect of the current reduced level of production is made clear.Having traded weaker earlier in Wednesday's session, oil prices moved into the black following the oil minister's comments. As of 13:20 p.m. London time, WTI crude prices had rebounded to trade slightly higher at $43.64 while Brent advanced modestly on the session to $46.11.With the step up in bin Salman's power, traders will be watching for signs of a further deterioration in the relationship between these Middle Eastern neighbors, given that the successful functioning of the production cut deal relies heavily upon their ongoing cooperation.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

"A sudden upswing in crude futures could be enough to fast-track the energy market’s next crisis, one economist told CNBC on Thursday.Oil prices soared to levels not seen since late 2014 on Thursday, following reports OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia would be content to see crude prices rally as high as $100 a barrel over the coming months.“Oil prices are high because the dollar is low,” Daniel Lacalle, chief economist at Tressis Gestion, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” Thursday.He went on to warn that “massive supply management” in the energy market was always likely to trigger an “artificial” upswing in oil prices. “That is a big concern … Because oil prices don’t generate crises; the abrupt and unexpected rise of oil prices creates crises,” Lacalle said.OPEC, Russia and several other allied producers have led an ongoing effort to try to clear a global supply overhang and prop up prices. The agreement, which came into effect in January 2017, has already been extended through until the end of this year — with producers scheduled to meet in June to review policy.The initial target of the supply-cutting deal was to reduce industrialized nations’ oil inventories back to their five-year average. Nonetheless, with several major global producers honing in on achieving their original aim, there is little indication from the world’s top exporter that it wishes to wind down the supply cuts.In fact, Saudi Arabia is thought to be happy to see crude futures rally up to triple digits in the near term, according to a Reuters report citing three unnamed industry sources.The news prompted oil prices to surge to multi-year highs Thursday. Brent crude futures traded at $74.11 during mid-morning deals, up around 0.9 percent, while WTI was at $69.04, approximately 0.8 percent higher. Both benchmarks had peaked at their highest respective levels since late 2014 earlier in the session.Reports that Saudi Arabia could be supportive of a further uptick in oil prices comes at a time when the kingdom is undergoing final preparations for its planned sale of a minority stake in state oil company, Saudi Aramco.An initial public offering (IPO) for Aramco on a major international exchange was planned for this year, but is now widely expected to occur in 2019, following a listing on the domestic Tadawul exchange.Aramco CEO Amin Nasser says his company is ready to go public, but is waiting for the government to decide where to list shares.Saudi Arabia aims to raise about $100 billion and attract a valuation of $2 trillion in the offering, though other analysis suggests a $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion valuation is more likely.The IPO is the cornerstone of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious effort to diversify Saudi Arabia’s oil-dependent economy.Meanwhile, OPEC and its partners are poised to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on Friday.

"Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, who runs the world's largest oil company, is taking the rise of electric vehicles in stride.Growing adoption of electric vehicles stands to put a big dent in oil demand in the coming years. Barclays recently forecast that cleaner-burning cars could wipe out crude consumption nearly equal to annual output from Iran, OPEC's third-biggest oil producer, by 2025. But while electric vehicle manufacturers are making ""good progress,"" battery and hybrid cars still account for just a fraction of the overall market, Nasser told CNBC in an exclusive interview. They won't account for a significant part of the global fleet for years to come, he said.The number of electric vehicles grew to just more than 2 million in 2016, up nearly 60 percent from the previous year, according to the International Energy Agency. They now make up about 0.2 percent of all cars on the road — a ""very small percentage,"" in Nasser's view.Nasser also points out that hybrid-electric vehicles with gas engines make up a big chunk of the total. There were about 805,000 plug-in hybrid electric cars in the world in 2016, according to IEA. That's 40 percent of all electric vehicles.By 2030, IEA projects the electric fleet could grow to 160 million, he noted. By that time, there will be 2 billion vehicles overall, Nasser estimates. ""So the number of conventional vehicles still in the market, even though they are more efficient for sure, is still a lot compared to what we have today,"" he told ""Squawk Box"" anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin in an interview conducted on Sunday from the command center at Saudi Aramco headquarters in Dhahran.""So electric vehicles will continue to grow. They will take good market share, but it will be decades before they shoulder a significant percentage of the energy mix,"" he said.In a more conservative scenario, electric vehicles total 56 million by 2030, IEA reports. In another scenario in which the world tackles climate change aggressively, the electric vehicle market exceeds 200 million by that year.The energy industry, in general, is making sure it has the right reserve levels and oil production capacity to prepare for the future and to supply the world with adequate energy, Nasser said. Crude oil will continue to play a major role in heavy shipping, aviation and petrochemicals, he added.Saudi Aramco is also identifying new uses for crude oil, particularly in the petrochemicals sector, which uses byproducts from fossil fuels to create plastics and specialty chemicals.""The chemical business grows at about 3 percent, much more than the growth of the transport sector. What can we do to grow that even further by identifying a new usage?"" he said.More from Global Investing Hot Spots:The 'sweet spots' fueling the US shale oil boom 'will not last forever,' Saudi Aramco CEO saysSaudi Aramco's IPO, the world's largest ever, is 'on track' for 2018, CEO Amin Nasser saysMore than 5% of Saudi Aramco could be offered beyond the IPO, Saudi billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal says",pos
"The Chinese government had talks about possibly financing the world’s most ambitious investment project, SoftBank’s $100 billion bet on the future of technology known as the Vision Fund.China’s largest sovereign wealth fund, the China Investment Corporation, last year spoke with the Vision Fund about making an investment, according to five people with knowledge of or briefed on the conversations. A contribution from CIC, which has $800 billion to invest, would have been very politically controversial, but it would also supply the Vision Fund, led by CEO Masayoshi Son, with a steady spring of capital for  future versions of SoftBank’s project.Sources differ on how serious the talks became, but a contribution has yet to materialize, leading many to believe that the chance of an investment at this point in this fund is unlikely. China could still strike a deal that would allow SoftBank to invest alongside it, these sources say, though SoftBank is said to be discouraged by the political and regulatory risks that would come with accepting Chinese investors into their fund.SoftBank declined to comment. CIC spokespeople did not respond to repeated requests for comment.SoftBank’s Vision Fund is also serious enough about China that it had been scouting last year for a new local partner to lead its investing in Chinese companies, two people familiar with the conversations tell Recode. The aim was to bolster SoftBank’s on-the-ground connections. The fund had deep recruiting conversations with at least one senior China candidate, the people said.The moves shed light on the challenges for SoftBank in China, as well as China’s ambitions outside its borders. A deal would appeal to both sides for a few reasons, at least on paper.To begin with, SoftBank, for all its riches, has been slow to do a final close on the Vision Fund, which currently stands at $92 billion, short of its $100 billion target. The firm originally said the fund would close by the end of 2017 but  now says it will reach its financing target by this June. SoftBank has, of course, been pitching almost all the top sovereign funds as it works to close the fund.A deal with China would also give Son a powerful ally in Beijing, where he has had at times a rocky relationship, and where he made his name with a landmark bet on Alibaba in 1999.SoftBank failed to make headway in China when it first entered the market 18 years ago. Son made a play to invest in the country through the creation of a fund focused on early-stage investments there. But ties between SoftBank and the fund weakened as Son grew more interested in later-stage deals; the fund still exists but now has outside investors beyond SoftBank.More from Recode: Facebook is defending itself again after an internal memo suggested growth was more important than user safetyTim Cook’s advice to his younger self: ‘The joy is in the journey’Snap is laying off around 100 more people, this time in salesChina could still be attractive for future Vision Funds. Saudi Arabia, which, like China, has eagerly sought to diversify its assets and invest overseas, has been expected globally to help finance SoftBank’s investments in part through the $1.5 trillion initial public offering of Aramco, the kingdom’s state-owned oil company.But  delays of the IPO, plus the general political upheaval in the nation, could mean that the Vision Fund needs to more aggressively court other sources of money.What would a deal have offered the Chinese? The CIC needs places to park its cash, and there is no bigger repository than the Vision Fund. While the CIC has long been a limited partner in some of Silicon Valley’s top growth and private equity funds, the CIC’s budget means it does not have time for smaller placements of capital into smaller investment pools, like standard venture capital funds.China’s CIC is also trying to become a big player in U.S. technology.  It plans to open an office in San Francisco in order to more easily make direct investments into Silicon Valley. It is also staffing up in New York City.But its track record in U.S. technology is considered by almost all veteran tech investors  to be quite poor, mostly because it cannot get access to the best companies. That means the investments that it does make are generally in less-desirable startups. Decisionmaking within the sovereign wealth fund is also described as slow and bureaucratic.Putting its money into SoftBank would give it access to the tech players it might not otherwise be able to reach.Another reason why the CIC may want to work through the Vision Fund — politics. The U.S. government closely scrutinizes Chinese deals in the U.S. through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The CIC has  criticized the Trump administration for what it sees as a tough, opaque crackdown, and running the deals under a SoftBank banner might solve the regulatory problem.But the Vision Fund, according a source familiar with the fund, has ratcheted back some of its ambitions in China exactly due to CFIUS considerations. Chinese investment through a fund could still trigger government scrutiny.The Trump administration, for instance, recently blocked the  takeover bid of U.S company Qualcomm by the Singapore-based Broadcom, on national security grounds. Broadcom had already maneuvered to re-domicile in the U.S., potentially making a CFIUS review moot, but that didn’t sway the Trump administration from moving to block the deal.These latest developments now suggest it may be too late for CIC to strike a deal with SoftBank. The Trump Administration’s tough stance toward China has scared Chinese investors trying to deploy cash in the U.S., sources say.There is another option on the table, according to sources with knowledge of the talks. China and SoftBank could enter into what’s known as a “co-investing” relationship. Under that kind of understanding — formal or informal — CIC would be introduced to some of the best technology deals outside of China without having to pay management fees to the Vision Fund. And CIC could correspondingly help the Vision Fund hear about the best opportunities in China, where it similarly wants to do more.CIC is said to be impressed with the prestige of the Vision Fund, according to multiple people who have spoken with the sovereign fund recently, and is attracted to the chance to tie its brand to Son much like the CIC did to Goldman Sachs. Last year, the two entities entered into a  partnership for a $5 billion fund to invest in U.S. manufacturing. CIC also recently  pulled out of an investment deal with Blackstone.SoftBank has also been more aggressively chasing deals in China, sources say. The Vision Fund is planning to put money into at least two separate Chinese startups. Both those investments were part of the same funding rounds in which CIC also participated. It’s not known which companies received the funding, though the Vision Fund  reportedly is considering an investment in Manbang Group.Those deals drew notice because — with some notable exceptions — the Vision Fund and CIC have not historically invested in the same round of a startup, close observers of the relationship say. Going ahead with the investments is a sign of SoftBank’s renewed push into China.",pos

I think we’re just stuck in the middle of a range,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial.“Of course, there are still a lot of geopolitical tensions out there, but the market could also be responding to the lack of fireworks” from the U.S.-China meeting last week, Cardillo said.President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the Mar-a-Lago in Florida last week, in which the two leaders struck a friendly note. Some market participants looked at the meeting as a potential risk for stocks.Investors also contended with a U.S. airstrike on a Syrian airfield late Thursday and, on Saturday, a U.S. official told Reuters that a U.S. Navy strike group will be moving close to the Korean peninsula as a show of force.“The equity markets escaped through a minefield of potentially damaging economic and geopolitical news and events last week to finish the period little changed,” Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, said in a note.“The geopolitical developments add a level of uncertainty but could serve the markets well by keeping investor confidence from gaining too strong a foothold,” Bittles said.But Sam Stovall of CFRA Research noted Monday that “shock” events like the Syria attack don’t typically derail a bull market’s long-term outlook.  That’s why the market was able to quickly recover, the analyst said.Stocks got off to a roaring start this year, posting solid gains for the first quarter. That said, the surge in stock prices has increased valuation concerns ahead of a highly anticipated earnings season. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are among the companies set to report this week.“At least right now, what I’m most interested in this week is hearing from the bank CEO’s who report earnings on Thursday,” said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. “Are companies tapping the capital markets instead of utilizing bank loans? Are companies just lessening their demand for credit because of already high leverage ratios?”Overseas, European equities ended mostly flat, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index closing just below breakeven.

"Saudi Arabia’s oil production agreement with Russia was opportunistic at first, but it is now the foundation for a broader relationship that has the potential to reduce already waning U.S. influence in the Middle East.Experts note that Russia has relationships with many powers in the Middle East and is the only one that can deal with everyone, including Israel, Iran, Syria and even Hamas and Hezbollah. The United States, on the other hand, is at odds with Syria and has increasingly chilly relations with Iran.It was the United States, ironically, that drove Russia and Saudi Arabia together in the first place, with the surprising rise of an oil sector that is now producing record-high volumes, last seen in 1970.With the cut in Saudi production, the United States’ still-growing output of 10 million barrels a day is now more than Saudi Arabia’s and catching up to No. 1 producer Russia. Even with this surge, the United States is still reliant on about 8 million barrels a day of imports, some of which come from Saudi Arabia.“What I think is brilliant about [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is, there was an immediate imperative to get this done because of U.S. production, but I think Putin understood the opportunity there was for Russia to take a role with OPEC,” said Helima Croft, RBC global head of commodities strategy. “He leveraged it to expand Russia’s regional influence.”Georgetown University Professor Angela Stent said it may be that Saudi Arabia believes Russia could help it with Iran, which it fears will develop nuclear weapons and is on the opposite side from Saudi in a proxy war in Yemen.“I think the Saudis are in this for geopolitical reasons, and even though Trump went to Saudi Arabia and it’s supposed to be this great relationship, the Saudis are casting around and realizing Russia has taken up a lot of slack for the United States in the Middle East,” said Stent, who is the director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies and a professor in the Department of Government and the School of Foreign Service.Croft said the United States has left a vacuum with its shifting Middle East policies. “I think our Iran policy, what happened in Syria, they did not think America was a stalwart. Then you have the Russians. They were willing to be more transactional with them,” Croft said.“Right now Russia and Saudi Arabia’s relationship is becoming thicker than oil,” Croft said. As for the Saudis, “I think they see themselves as trying to show the Russians they have a better friend in the Middle East (than Iran).”The United States began to particularly waiver on Middle East policy in the past five years. “It certainly was diminishing under Obama,” Stent said, pointing to the 2013 comments by Obama that if Syria crossed the red line of using chemicals, the United States would act. But the U.S. did not.The seeds were planted even before that, in the George W. Bush administration.“We went into Iraq. It didn’t go the way we thought it was going to go. What it did was allow Iran to come in and increase its influence. For countries that consider Iran to be an existential threat, this was a big mistake because that was the outcome of the war,” Stent said.Both Stent and Croft are speaking at IHS Markit’s annual CERAWeek conference in Houston this week.Meanwhile, the Russia-Saudi partnership is progressing, with state-owned Saudi Aramco reportedly making an investment in a Russian Arctic liquefied natural gas project and the Russian Direct Investment Fund expected to invest in the Saudi Aramco’s IPO, Croft noted.“I think it is a strategic alliance when it comes to energy that could well extend to other things. They discussed in the past military matters, purchasing military goods. They talked about investing in Russia. It’s not just purely an energy relationship. It’s more of a strategic political relationship that started as energy reform,” said John Sfakianakis, director of economics research at the Gulf Research Center in Riyadh.The agreement between OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, with Russia and other producers is expected to run into 2019, but it could be up for discussion when OPEC meets in June. Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih has said the deal will be reviewed next year for possible changes, but Russian companies have been eager to increase production.“Going forward, this arrangement has to hold. It needs to remain for quite some time so oil prices remain at this range of $60ish for some time. It suits everybody, especially the producing countries — $60/$65 is a good price from the $30 we had a couple of years ago. It helps everybody. It keeps the balance of payments in good order. My take is, this arrangement will hold, at least for the rest of the year, and then we’ll see what they do,” said Sfakianakis.The pact came at a strategic moment for Saudi Arabia, which is trying to transform itself into a country with a much more diverse economy. A stronger oil price is helpful.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is driving Vision 2030, a reform movement aimed at modernizing Saudi Arabia and developing new jobs in industries such as technology, entertainment and tourism. Selling shares in Saudi Aramco to the public is a cornerstone of the strategy, and it will enable a Saudi sovereign fund to diversify the kingdom’s holdings.U.S.-Russia relations have also skidded to a new low, with the special prosecutor’s ongoing investigation alleging Russians meddled in the U.S. election process. Russia also remains under sanctions for its incursion into Ukraine. ”[Relations] haven’t been this low since Gorbachev came to power,” said Georgetown’s Stent.Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, has been a longtime ally of the United States and remains close. Bin Salman, expected to become king after his father, will be visiting the United States later this month. “Trump’s first visit and trip abroad was to Saudi Arabia. What he signaled was a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia, and a lot of that was about money,” Stent said, noting the trip coincided with a big arms deal announcement.“If there is a broader and more structured [Mideast] policy, I don’t know what it is,” said Stent, adding that “if the U.S. wants to be more of a player in the region, it has to talk to Iran.”Stent said the Saudi relationship with the United States remains strong.“I think it’s probably hedging its bets. I think the test of this will come if they do believe Russia can restrain what Iran does. At what point are they going to decide if that is or isn’t true? What the Israelis are concerned about is the Iranians will establish military airbases in Syria. The Saudis might not like that, but they have more concerns about them,” said Stent.",pos
"One of the world's richest men and most sought-after investors has been under arrest and even reportedly tortured for more than three weeks. That man is billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. He owns major stakes in Twitter and Citigroup. He was a key shareholder in 21st Century FOX. His television interviews, including on CNBC, are promoted with ""must-watch"" status. He's routinely called the ""Warren Buffett of Saudi Arabia.""But since November 5, bin Talal has been detained in a room at the Ritz Carlton in Riyadh. The hotel has become a de facto prison for more than 200 of his fellow princes and Saudi officials as new Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman conducts a sweeping and stunning purge of his real and potential political opponents.To make matters worse, several credible reports have surfaced that bin Talal and the others are being tortured.  One report says he's been hung upside down and beaten. Those stories gained a level of credence earlier this week when another prince, Miteb bin Abdullah, paid a reported $1 billion for his freedom.As bin Salman pushes to beef up Saudi Arabia's military power and alliances against Iran, the official reason for these arrests is that they are part of an ""anti-corruption probe."" But of course, the kingdom is not presenting anything in the way of documented evidence. That's not how they roll in a regime that  Human Rights Watch points out has no written penal code or criminal rights.That brings us to an uncomfortable question: Where are Prince bin Talal's powerful business partners and political contacts who have been seen with him at DAVOS or dozens of other major world events?This was the man who stuck his neck out for years in support of the Murdoch family. And that includes the period in 2011 when  calls to oust Rupert Murdoch and his sons were running high after the British News of the World phone tapping scandal. There has been no real protest on his behalf from the Murdochs or in their newspapers and TV networks.Others,  like Bill Gates who called him an ""important partner,"" have made lukewarm statements this past week. But none have met the level of urgency appropriate for a man detained with no documented charges and possibly under physical harm.Likewise, our political leadership on both sides of the aisle seems to be ignoring the story.So why this apparent acceptance of tyranny and brutality against an important global investor who appeared to be a friend of the West?The explanation is part economics and part politics, but the consequences for such silence could be devastating.Let's start with economics. The financial world has long been awaiting what will be the biggest IPO of all time: Saudi Aramco. This is a company that's already estimated valuations of anywhere between $1 trillion to $2 trillion. It's the definition of the term ""big deal."" Everyone wants a piece.There's a concerted effort by bin Salman to  keep too many members of the extended family from interfering in Aramco's operations and spending. These arrests may have a lot to do with that effort. Either way, supporting bin Talal and the other detained princes with even a strongly worded statement could poison a foreign investor's Aramco prospects.The political reasons are a little less clear, but we do know there is strong support in the Trump administration for bin Salman's plan to cultivate a new partnership with Israel and his efforts to disrupt the long Saudi-funded Wahabist terrorist network. He's also trying to culturally modernize the country and remove anti-Semitic clerics.bin Talal has never been solidly linked to terror, but he has been critical of Israel. bin Salman may be looking to remove all doubts that he is serious about putting a lid on all real and possible sources for terror support.So for the Trump administration, supporters of Israel, and everyone else worried about Iran, there's a relatively clear acceptance of bin Salman's moves to achieve a greater good in the Middle East. The ends apparently justify the means.But that's a clear moral hazard. When a nation accepts brutality and tyranny in one regime in order in order to stamp it out in another, blowback can happen. America should have learned that the hard way after its years of supporting the Shah of Iran and some other dictators in the region without any real pressure to introduce democratic reforms and the rule of law. Iran is a greater danger right now. But a more suppressive Saudi Arabia could be close behind. There's nothing democratic or civilized about what's happening now in Riyadh.Money and the push to challenge Iran are clearly silencing any protest so far. Maybe bin Talal isn't the most sympathetic victim. But his case is illuminating because he is so well connected and famous. What does that say about other Saudis who aren't?Perhaps these frightening means to the end will be worth it. But our track record in the Middle East doesn't make the odds all that encouraging.Commentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist.

"One of Saudi Arabia’s top financial regulators has admitted there are “execution risks” surrounding the huge reforms the country is embarking on, but spoke of the opportunities the changes could deliver. “We see an opportunity to reform and change the country like no time that we’ve experienced in the past,” Mohammed El-Kuwaiz, the chairman of the Saudi Arabian Capital Market Authority, told CNBC Friday.When asked broadly about any potential challenges, he said that the main risks are around execution.“Whenever you have something which has this high an aspiration level, and this tight a timeline, the challenge is to get it done and get it done with the right level of quality and the right level of sequence,” he said.“Our belief, at least in the capital market realm is that actually, at least in the last year the capital market authority and the exchange have done a great job in translating, not just plans, but translating them into execution.”Last year,  Saudi Arabia’s government unveiled a long-term economic blueprint for life in a low-oil-price world. Titled “Saudi Vision 2030,” the plan includes regulatory, budget and policy changes that will be implemented over the next 15 years in the hope of making the kingdom less reliant on crude. It aims to build a “prosperous and sustainable economic future” for the kingdom.Meanwhile, Mohammed El-Kuwaiz expressed confidence over the listing of the country’s state oil firm Aramco. The Saudi government is yet to announce whether Aramco’s primary listing will be in London or New York, but it has decided that a portion of the firm will be floated on the country’s domestic stock index the Tadawul.“We’ve found very few gaps in our local regulations and we’re actually ready with minimal changes to accommodate the Aramco IPO or any other big listing,” he told CNBC.The Saudi Arabian Capital Market Authority Chairman also argued that the much-anticipated IPO is galvanizing broader efforts to reform the country’s financial system.Correction: This article has been updated to accurately reflect the comments made by Mohammed El-Kuwaiz.",pos
"The powerful Saudi crown prince's purge of royals and ministers this weekend could pave the way for improved business conditions in the kingdom, analysts say. However, it also risks plunging Saudi Arabia into chaos if it touches off a showdown in the sprawling royal family, they warn.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has framed the arrest of 11 princes, four ministers and dozens of officials this weekend as a crackdown on corruption. Others have a called it a power grab meant to smooth the way for the 32-year-old's widely anticipated rise to the throne and his bid to overhaul the Saudi economy.However, several Middle East watchers rejected an either-or explanation. Instead they say the roundup has elements of an anti-corruption drive, a consolidation of power and a populist appeal to average Saudis fed up with royal excess.Bin Salman is ""trying to change the dynamic between politics and business in Saudi Arabia, centralize that in a way that's never been done before, and really show that the royal family is no longer immune to corruption charges in a way that they have been, really for the duration of their rule,"" Allison Wood, Middle East consultant at Control Risks Group, told CNBC Europe on Tuesday.More centralized decision-making could create greater certainty for international investors, said Michael Rubin, Middle East scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Rather than navigating a web of power centers run by thousands of princes, the business community would know exactly whose door to knock on, he said.Bin Salman ""wants to reform the economy, to modernize it, and he doesn't want to deal with resistance. The question is, what happens if he fails? Then you could see a regression in Saudi Arabia that leaves it far worse than it is now,"" Rubin told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Monday.""Ultimately there's a danger in consolidating policy into one single individual. When that individual is gone, then chaos can reign supreme. We're at a very dangerous time for Saudi Arabia right now.""It is also a time when Saudi Arabia is aggressively courting international investors.The kingdom is preparing to sell shares in state-owned Saudi Aramco, a tricky endeavor given the energy giant's notoriously opaque finances. The sale is the cornerstone of bin Salman's plan to expand Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and diversify its economy.Just last month, the country hosted a Future Investment Initiative conference that drew financial sector luminaries to the capital city of Riyadh. Those heavyweights included Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, a billionaire investor often referred to as the Warren Buffett of Saudi Arabia, who was among those swept up in the purge.In light of recent events, some investors may think twice about putting money to work in the kingdom in the near term, analysts say.""There'll be a concern about whether or not there's going to be stability in the kingdom or not, and that's going to raise questions about is this a good time to be investing?"" said Dennis Ross, a diplomat who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.The market should not expect Saudi Arabia to develop into a democracy any time soon, he said, but economic reform is a net positive for investors and stands to create a successful model of development that has been lacking in the Arab world. That absence is part of the reason extremist groups like the so-called Islamic State have flourished, added Ross, now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.Bin Salman has vowed to return Saudi Arabia to ""a more moderate Islam."" A hard-line conservative interpretation has dominated the kingdom for decades. Modernization and economic reform give Islamic nations a way to counter radicalization in the digital world, said Fred Kempe, president and CEO of the Atlantic Council.""Over the short term you're going to have a lot of investor nervousness ... but if this 32-year-old reformer stays in power, can actually change the kingdom ... he could be in power for 30, 40 years and this could be an amazing long-term play,"" Kempe told ""Power Lunch.""Still, the crackdown might have the opposite effect that bin Salman intended, according to Simon Henderson, director of the Washington Institute's Gulf and Energy Policy program. It could very well ""scare the hell out of potential investors"" who partner with the Saudis.In his view, the purge was indeed a ""power grab"" meant to sweep aside influential figures like Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the former head of the National Guard and an opponent of bin Salman's swift rise to power.Bin Salman ""needed to bypass Mutaib,"" Henderson told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Monday. ""To accuse him of corruption is a neat way of doing it.""While uncertainty stirred by the arrests will inevitably have an impact on investment, the main obstacle to doing business in Saudi Arabia is corruption, said Mohammed Alyahya, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council. But prosecuting corruption will actually alleviate longer-term uncertainty and promote transparency, he said.The purge ""stands to change a culture of corruption in the kingdom that can only be changed if a policy of cracking down on the bigwigs, if you like, without any half measures is embarked upon,"" he told ""Squawk on the Street.""Corruption is indeed endemic in Saudi Arabia, but the purge might not be the best way to deal with it, said Joseph Westphal, former U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia under President Barack Obama. Rather than rounding up royals, the Saudis could have better addressed corruption by reforming the country's judicial system.""I think as an investor I would want to make sure that I'm investing in a country where my corporate investment, my business is protected through some type of rule of law,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday.""I don't think that's there.""More from Global Investing Hot Spots:Saudi Aramco's IPO, the world's largest ever, is 'on track' for 2018, CEO Amin Nasser saysMore than 5% of Saudi Aramco could be offered beyond the IPO, Saudi billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed saysPrince Alwaleed says bitcoin will implode: 'Enron in the making'",pos
"Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, a prominent member of the country's royal family and a wealthy investor, has been swept up in connection with a wide-ranging anti-corruption initiative, according to reports.Saudi Arabia's King Salman removed a host of prominent officials in a sweeping crackdown, in which dozens of princes and former ministers were detained. News outlets, including Saudi-owned Al Arabiya and The Wall Street Journal, reported Bin Talal was among those arrested. CNBC could not immediately confirm Bin Talal's status.In addition to Bin Talal, former Finance Minister Ibrahim Al-Assaf was also detained and under investigation, Reuters reported, citing a senior Saudi official.If verified, the arrest of Bin Talal would represent a jarring turn of events as the prince has cultivated an image as the de-facto public face of Saudi finance. It would also be the most dramatic chapter in the evolving narrative of Bin Salman, who has steadily consolidated his authority since his elevation to Defense Minister in early 2015.Considered one of the most prominent members of the Saudi royal family, Bin Talal has been the subject of numerous profiles in U.S. and international publications. He has made numerous appearances on CNBC dispensing investment advice — such as last month, when he predicted bitcoin was little more than a speculative bubble that would soon ""implode""The billionaire is an American-educated philanthropist and investor who is heavily invested in U.S. corporate giants like Citigroup, Apple, 21st Century Fox and Twitter, just to name a few. Between 1991 and 1995, bin Talal came to the rescue of President Donald Trump, whose real estate empire was under strain. Bin Talal purchased a yacht, and invested in Trump's Plaza Hotel.In 2015, Bin Talal announced he would donate his entire fortune to help build a ""better world of tolerance, acceptance, equality and opportunity for all.""The anti-corruption sweep is taking place against a backdrop of reform in Saudi Arabia, and the impending launch of an initial public offering for state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco next year. The IPO is expected to be the largest in history, and Aramco is widely expected to dual-list shares on an international exchange.Saudi Arabia's Finance Ministry, for its part, said Sunday that the kingdom's decision to set up an anti-corruption committee and detain prominent figures enhanced confidence in the rule of law, Al Arabiya television reported.The decisions preserve Saudi Arabia's investment climate, the Saudi-owned television channel said.Saudi Arabia announced the committee and the detentions late on Saturday.—Reuters contributed to this report.",pos
"Saudi Arabia's richest man is running out of time.It's been more than two months since  Prince Alwaleed bin Talal was first arrested and detained in what the Saudi government still calls an ""anti-corruption"" sweep. Yet the first sign of things getting more serious came early this week when Alwaleed was moved out of his restricted quarters at the Riyadh Ritz Carlton Hotel and  moved to Al Ha'ir prison, according to the London-based Arabic news site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed. Al Ha'ir is not exactly the Bastille, but the decision to get Alwaleed to a more secluded and secure location is ominous.For more than two months, the prince had been held at the Riyadh Ritz along with what had originally been 200 of his fellow princes and top officials. That number has dwindled to just a few prisoners. Most of the former detainees have bought their freedom with payments and other forms of capitulation to the new Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.But bin Talal is holding out, reportedly balking at the  $6 billion bin Salman is demanding from him and/or control of some of his investment companies.Prince bin Salman came to power last summer when King Salman made the extremely unusual move to change the order of succession and make bin Salman crown prince.Since then he has been beefing up Saudi Arabia's military defenses against Iran, strengthening ties to the U.S. and even Israel in the process. In the fall, he further moved to purge the country of anti-Semitic and anti-American Islamic clerics. In November, bin Salman's economic reforms morphed into this arrest of Alwaleed and those 200 other princes and officials who were at least potential rivals in the overall power grab.It's not that many of the crown prince's goals aren't prudent or even admirable. But the matter of human rights is being pushed aside. So is due process.Another example of that happened this week with the  Saudi government's outright seizure of the Binladin Group construction giant. A Reuters report says the government has taken managerial control and may also erase up to $30 billion in debt it owes the company. This is happening as leading members of the Bin Laden family, yes the extended family of al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, were detained as well.One of the most stunning aspects of bin Talal's detention is how quiet his long list of influential friends have been about it. This week brought at least some mention of his plight with  a statement from two former French presidents who expressed concern over Alwaleed's status. But let's face it: a few words from a couple of French ex-presidents is peanuts.So now we have bin Alwaleed possibly in an actual prison, with a government aggressively taking cash and assets, and still no significant outcry from his foreign friends.It may seem unrelated, but bin Salman has also been on an opulent buying spree. That includes  record-breaking purchases of art, a yacht and a French chateau. It begs the question of whether some of this stems from his desire to be the most conspicuously wealthy leader in the country.This is similar to some of the tactics Russian President Vladimir Putin has used to consolidate his political power and personal wealth at the same time.None of this very public behavior is drawing public rebuke from the crown prince's friends in Trump administration and elsewhere. They are clearly okay with the ends justifying whatever means he's using to modernize the country and strengthen its ability to oppose Iran.The fact that  the lucrative Saudi Aramco IPO is coming soon could be another reason that Alwaleed's supposed friends in the world of finance aren't making a public stink. They want to curry favor with the Saudis now to gain access.This week's moves only drives that point home. Prince Alwaleed's leverage to demand an actual trial or negotiate a better deal is dwindling by the day. The cavalry is not coming and the Saudi government has almost no fear of international reprisal.The chances are greater than ever that Alwaleed will now rot in a literal jail for as long as the new government wants. Earlier reports that he was being  hung upside down and beaten at the Ritz Carlton are still unconfirmed, but no one should be surprised if that's the next step – if it hasn't been taken already.Prince Alwaleed must have thought at some point that he had the option of holding out for a fair hearing before being forced to hand over billions to save his skin. He doesn't have that option now and probably never did.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman isn't betting on seeing any pushback. Neither should anyone else.Commentary by Jake Novak, CNBC.com senior columnist. Follow him on Twitter @jakejakeny.For more insight from CNBC contributors, follow @CNBCopinion on Twitter.",pos
"The past year has proved to be an ideal environment for U.S. stock markets and for global growth. But what are going to be the drivers of investment decisions in 2018? Here I lay out just a couple of the questions that might shape some of the discussions for the coming year:2017 proved to be a poor year for the greenback, with the currency staging its weakest performance since 2003. This with a backdrop of three interest rate hikes, a tax reform bill that encourages repatriation of U.S. dollars held overseas, a strengthening U.S. economy and a soaring stock market. The justification has been that while the Federal Reserve may have been in tightening mode, they were no longer the only players in the room. 2017 also saw the first hike in a decade out of the Bank of England and even the ever-accommodative European Central Bank starting to scale back its stimulus. However, according to the latest CFTC Commitment of Traders Report, dollar positioning is starting the year quite short particularly against the euro (+$19.3 billion overall) which is the longest it has been since 2007. Furthermore, the bond market is still only pricing in around two further rate hikes from the Fed this year, even though Fed projections suggest three. Not to forget the changing composition of the Fed members and the slight hawkish tilt to minutes suggesting an upside to growth.2018 is certainly shaping up to be a tense year politically: Germany does not yet have a government, all polls for Italian elections are pointing to a hung parliament. And Brexit negotiations are now in phase two with still very little clarity from the government on what the shape of the final trading arrangement might look like. This uncertainty clouds investment decisions and is one of the reasons the Bank of England and the U.K. statistics office have revised down growth projections. Meanwhile in the U.S., while President Donald Trump can tick off passing tax reform from his list of first year achievements, the discourse has now shifted on to the state of his mental health as well as the mid-term elections with a possible comeback by the Democrats. Finally, the threat of the ""bigger nuclear button"" is still very much in the background.Other questions for 2018: Can FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet's Google) repeat their 50 percent-plus performance of last year? Have we witnessed the full extent of ""Amazonfication"" yet (answer is probably not)? What valuation will the Saudi Aramco IPO (initial public offering) secure when/if it comes to the market? And lastly, what cryptocurrency will prove to be the ""fairest of them all""? Let's wait and see.For more insight from CNBC contributors, follow

"Saudi Arabia’s state-run oil company has said that production will trend slightly higher this year as it detailed plans to become  the world’s leading energy and chemicals company by 2020.  Speaking on Tuesday, the president of Saudi Aramco, or to give it  its full name, the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, said that despite the  current oil market environment remaining “challenging,” the  company is still looking for growth opportunities and joint  ventures.  President and Chief Executive Amin Hassan Nasser told journalists  that the company - which recently announced it’s to sell a 5  percent stake - was still looking to expand its oil operations  and was also looking at new joint ventures in the U.S., India,  China and Indonesia. Over the next decade, the company expects to indirectly add 500,000 jobs to the kingdom’s economy, al-Nasser told  reporters. Currently it employs 66,000 people.  Presenting the Saudi Aramco strategy at the press conference, the  company said that “by 2020, we intend to be the world leading  integrated energy and chemicals company, focused on maximizing  value creation across the hydrocarbon chain, facilitating the  sustainable expansion of the Kingdom’s economy and enabling a  vibrant Saudi energy sector.”  He also told reporters that demand for Saudi Aramco’s oil is  increasing and the company was ramping up production to meet that  demand.   “We will meet the call on Saudi Aramco ... The trend is  increasing,” he told reporters, according to Reuters. “We are  seeing demand growth in different places. We are seeing increases  in India, in the U.S., and we are meeting that call on us.” He  added that he expected total oil demand to climb by 1.2 million  barrels per day this year.  Nasser’s comments come after Saudi Aramco’s Chairman Khalid al-Falih was made Saudi Arabia’s  new energy minister at the weekend, replacing Ali al-Naimi  who had held the post since 1995. Read More Power and a  ‘brutal’ battle against Iran: What the Saudi reshuffle REALLY  means  The comments also come after a U.K. newspaper reported that Saudi  Aramco was planning a 3-way listing in New York, London and Hong  Kong and planned to sell a 5 percent stake in the firm. The  Telegraph newspaper said on Monday that the state-run oil  company was hoping to lure ExxonMobil, China’s Sinopec and BP  into buying into the company.  Nasser said that the company was looking at the logistics of an  Initial Public Offering (IPO) but would not comment on  speculation over targeted buyers.  “Right now we are just looking at how much to list and where to  list at this stage and until now there is no discussion about  stakes by this company or that and now we are just looking at  where to list.”    “As Saudi Aramco we are not talking to any of these companies  about the listing of Aramco,” he insisted.  The sale of Aramco is planned as soon as 2017 or 2018 and would  in theory be five times larger than any initial public offering  (IPO) in history.  It is expected to be valued at more than  $2 trillion. Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first  announced the decision to sell in April as Saudi Arabia’s  government unveiled a long-term economic blueprint for life in a  low-oil-price world.  Nasser would not be drawn on the valuation, however.  “I will not talk about valuation – it depends on  so many things (and) it is too early –until we go to  the market,” he said. He told CNBC that a listing would take at  some point because of the sheer size of the company. He added  that a time frame for the sale would soon be made public.

"OPEC is expected to extend its agreement with Russia and other non-OPEC countries to curb production, even as U.S. shale production and exports continue to grow, according to a CNBC oil survey.About 80 percent of the oil analysts and traders surveyed by CNBC also agree the market, which had been heavily oversupplied, is showing signs of rebalancing. Forty-four percent say the rebalancing can continue if U.S. production, blamed for the glut, does not rise much more. Thirteen percent say if the U.S. output continues to grow, the rebalancing will end, as it will lead to oversupply.The OPEC agreement, struck with Russia a year ago, is seen as a factor helping drive a turnaround in oil prices. Ninety-four percent of the 16 survey participants expect the price for West Texas Intermediate crude to end the year at about where it is now — $50 to $60 per barrel. But more than half, 56 percent, said there's a chance crude could fall back into the $40s in 2018.OPEC meets in Vienna on Thursday, and the market has been expecting its deal with Russia and other producers to hold back 1.8 million barrels a day to be extended to the end of the year. Reuters reported Tuesday that sources said the technical committee of OPEC and the non-OPEC members recommended extending the agreement through the end of the year with a review in June.Michael Cohen, head of commodities research at Barclays, said he had expected a six- or nine-month extension of the agreement, which is due to end in March, but he adds that the extension length is less important than the quota. He said the technical committee and Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee can recommend changes at any time.""Even if the deal ends, we would not expect an onslaught of new production from participants,"" Cohen wrote in his answer to the survey.Russia has been a bit of a wild card. Russian companies had complained that U.S. shale was biting into market share, while they held to an agreement to keep their own production off the world market. Eighty-one percent of the survey participants expect Russia to be part of OPEC's deal Thursday.The deal has been important to Saudi Arabia, as it needs a high oil price for its Vision 2030 program to transform the country's economy. In the survey, 81 percent said Saudi Arabia was ""jawboning"" the price of oil higher, ahead of its IPO of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company.The survey also focused on other factors that could impact oil prices. Forty-four percent said they expect the Trump administration's decertification of the Iran nuclear deal will result in reimposition of sanctions on Iran, but 31 percent do not believe it will, while 25 percent are unsure. Sixty-nine percent expect to see Venezuelan oil supply to take a further hit next year.A full 100 percent expect U.S. oil production to continue to rise and impact market dynamics.""Increased U.S. production has taken away a significant portion of OPEC's power. As long as crude hovers near $60, I think that domestic production will continue to ramp,"" wrote Jim Iurio of TJM institutional Services. ",pos
"Saudi Arabia’s government has unveiled a long-term economic blueprint for life in a low-oil-price world.Titled “Saudi Vision 2030,” the plan unveiled Monday includes regulatory, budget and policy changes that will be implemented over the next 15 years in the hope of making the kingdom less reliant on crude. It aims to build a “prosperous and sustainable economic future” for the kingdom, according to the press release.  Launching the program, the country’s leadership said it would be  built around three themes for a “vibrant society”, “a thriving  economy” and an “ambitious nation.” The plan highlighted the country  would raise its share of non-oil exports in non-oil gross domestic product (GDP) from 16 percent to  50 percent.  In a wide-ranging press conference in the capital Riyadh, Deputy  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman addressed the different aspects  of the announcement. The plan details the future of privatization  in Saudi Arabia and the creation of what it calls the “largest  sovereign wealth fund in the world.” Prince Mohammed told CNBC  that a new sovereign wealth fund could top $3  trillion and would be linked to its vast revenues from oil.The planned economic diversification also involved localizing  renewable energy and industrial equipment sectors and creating  high-quality tourism attractions. It also plans to make it easier  to apply for visas and hoped to create 90,000 job opportunities  in its mining sector.  “We will smooth the process of listing private Saudi companies  and state-owned enterprises, including Aramco. This will require  deepening liquidity in our capital markets, fortifying the role  of the debt market and paving the way for the derivatives  market,” the announcement said.  The reforms also included announcements in digital  infrastructure, culture, education and the military. Prince  Mohammed told reporters Monday that Saudi Arabia could achieve  its vision with oil at just $30 a barrel.“We can achieve this vision even if oil is lower  than $30. We think it is almost impossible to go under $30 because of global demand,”  Prince Mohammed said in the news conference, according to Reuters. “The plan can deal with any price, $30, $28, $70...  but the plan was made with $30 in mind.”The announcement comes hours after Saudi Arabia confirmed that it  planned to sell a stake of its state oil giant Saudi Aramco which  was expected to be valued at more than $2 trillion.  The sale would be less than 5 percent of the company and would be  via an initial public offering (IPO), Deputy Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman said in a television interview with the Al  Arabiya News Channel.  He also said there were plans for Aramco, or to give it its full  name Arabian American Oil Company, to be transformed into a  holding company with an elected board, according to Reuters, with  subsidiaries of the firm also to be sold by IPO.  There were also details of how the ultra-conservative Muslim  kingdom would increase women’s participation in the workforce  from 22 percent to 30 percent. It also said it would lower the  rate of unemployment from 11.6 percent to 7 percent.“With over 50 percent of our university graduates being female, we  will continue to develop their talents, invest in their  productive capabilities and enable them to strengthen their  future and contribute to the development of our society and  economy,” the press release stated. —CNBC’s Nyshka Chandran contributed to this  article.",pos

"The mass weekend arrests by Saudi Arabia could be due to both the stated purpose of cracking down on corruption and a power grab by the kingdom’s young, reform-minded crown prince who may soon take the throne, said Robert Jordan, former U.S. ambassador to the kingdom.On Saturday, 11 princes, including well-known billionaire investor Alwaleed bin Talal, and four ministers, including the one in charge of the National Guard, were arrested, according to various reports, along with a number of former ministers.Two weeks ago, Alwaleed, who spoke to CNBC in an extensive interview from his apartment in Riyadh, talked about the massive upcoming Saudi Aramco IPO, his vast investments in shares of U.S. corporations and what he called “a lot of good policies” of President Donald Trump.“This would be like arresting Warren Buffett or Bill Gates in the United States,” Jordan told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday.“We’ve got to figure out what the basis of these charges could be” against the Saudi royals and high-ranking government ministers and former officials, he urged. “The Saudis are going to have to be transparent about what happens. We’re going to have to understand why it is that these leaders have be incarcerated.”The arrests happened hours after King Salman created an anti-corruption committee chaired by his 32-year-old son, Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman. MBS, as the crown prince is known, could become king later this year or in early 2018 when his 81-year-old father abdicates the throne.Jordan, the top U.S. diplomat to Saudi Arabia during the presidency of George W. Bush, said the kingdom has long had a problem with corruption, so the weekend actions could be partly a crackdown. But he also said the moves could be MBS consolidating his power.“I think both conditions could actually be true. It’s a huge story either way it goes,” argued Jordan, currently a political science professor at Southern Methodist University and a longtime partner in the international law firm Baker Botts, where he had headed the Mideast practice in Dubai.“Certainly Saudi Arabia has had a corruption problem for many years. I think the population, especially, has been very unhappy with princes coming in and grabbing business deals, with public funds going to flood control projects that never seem to get built” for example, Jordan said.However, he added, “I would also say it’s a classical power grab move sometimes to arrest your rivals, your potential rivals under the pretext of corruption.”The crown prince is also currently trying to diversify the Saudi economy, traditionally tied closely to oil revenues, through a plan called “Vision 2030.”",pos
"Saudi Aramco may be the object of intense worldwide speculation, as investment banks and global stock exchanges salivate at the prospect of the expected largest IPO ever, but Saudi Arabia actually has much more than its oil sector to offer investors.And the state energy giant, which is expecting to raise as much as $100 billion as it lists a small portion of the company next year, is part of the kingdom’s plan to unlock its hidden economic treasures.“The money that will come in is not money they’ll put in the bank at 2 percent interest,” said Tom McNulty, a director specializing in the energy sector at Navigant Consulting. “It’s for turning one industry into 10 to 12 industries.”This diversification away from oil is the reason why King Salman bin Abdulaziz recently spent a month in Asia, signing multi-billion dollar deals with Indonesia, Malaysia, China and Japan. The kingdom’s government is now pushing for more public-private partnerships, and Saudi Arabia says it wants to increase foreign direct investment from the current 3.8 percent to 5.7 percent of GDP by 2030.“We see utilities, airports, health care and real estate holding the best opportunities from the point of view of public-private partnerships,” said Saleem Khokhar, head of fund management at National Bank of Abu Dhabi.As the kingdom opens its door wider to foreign investors, here’s where other opportunities lie:It’s not just oil buried in Saudi Arabia’s land: The country has a treasure trove of other natural resources.“It has promising sites of minerals such as gold, silver, copper, iron, platinum and other strategic materials,” said Jaap Meijer, head of equity research at Arqaam Capital, an emerging markets investment bank based in Dubai.In fact, Alcan Primary Metal Group, a Rio Tinto subsidiary, and the Saudi Arabian Mining Company recently signed a $7 billion joint venture agreement to mine bauxite reserves in the northern part of the kingdom. The plan is to produce 720,000 tons of aluminum per year.“I remember when I was there, everyone would say how rich the country is with other resources,” said Mark Keenan, who used to invest for members of the Saudi royal family and is now managing director and head of commodities research in Asia for Societe Generale. “To mine this stuff, you need to be a BHP or a Rio.”The kingdom’s road map to diversify away from oil is spelled out in its Saudi Vision 2030 plan, in which it acknowledges that “we still lack a competitive renewable energy sector at present.”One near term goal is to maximize solar and wind power in the country by generating 9.5 gigawatts of renewable energy.Germany’s Phoenix Solar has a head start in Saudi Arabia. In 2012 and 2014, the photovoltaics company built two solar panel parks on the site of the kingdom’s petroleum research center in Riyadh. Saudi Aramco ordered the 3.5 megawatt and 1.8 megawatt solar parks.And Phoenix Solar has seven to eight more projects in the pipeline in Saudi Arabia, according to Klaus Friedl, managing director for Phoenix Solar Oman, which is executing the projects. Looking ahead, he said that upcoming competition in the country doesn’t worry him.“There is real competition with about 20 to 30 companies who might be interested and submit bids for upcoming tenders. But in reality, the maximum is 10 competitors who are really in a position to win,” said Friedl. “You need at least Saudi Arabian or GCC experience. You need at least a few power plants as reference projects and you need financial facilities for Saudi bonds.”One key to growing the economy is opening up the capital markets. The Saudi Stock Exchange — also called the Tadawul, which means “trading” in Arabic — has a market capitalization of more than $400 billion reflected in the Tadawul All Share Index. All of the 176 listed names are Saudi companies.Mohammed El-Kuwaiz, vice chairman of the Capital Market Authority, regulates the exchange and envisions a day when foreign companies can list.“The Saudi capital market was an island unto itself. It was viewed as targeting local issuers and investors,” El-Kuwaiz recently told CNBC.Right now, the only way a foreigner can invest in the Saudi equity market is by registering as a Qualified Foreign Investor (QFI), and the conditions are restrictive. Those foreign investors are generally large financial institutions or fund managers that must have at least 3.75 billion Saudi riyals ($1 billion) in assets under management.QFIs — including HSBC, which was one of the first foreign institutions to get the Saudi license — will have the right to subscribe in IPOs on the Tadawul, which is where Saudi Aramco is expected to have its primary listing.In February, the Saudi Stock Exchange launched a parallel market called Nomu, which has “lighter listing requirements” for domestic companies that want to go public. The Nomu, which means “growth” in Arabic, has seven listed companies with a total market cap of $518 million. After two years on the parallel market, a company may qualify to list on the main Tadawul index. These companies are also open to QFI investors.While several sectors may seem promising to investors, opening up the Saudi economy means changing several entrenched traditions. For example, allowing more women in the workforce or meeting Western expectations of transparency.“Saudi is like a family business,” said Keenan of Societe Generale. “It’s not like they publish reserves — nor do they need to. They’re perfectly happy producing oil. No one’s gone in there and done feasibility studies.”That is about to change as engineering audits are reportedly underway in Saudi Arabia to determine the value of Aramco’s oil reserves. “It’s the first fresh clean look in a long time,” said Navigant’s McNulty.“The biggest challenges are access to credit, Saudization policies (requirements to hire locals) and the lack of skills among the domestic workforce,” said Jaap Meijer of Arqaam Capital.A major stumbling block has been the upgrading of skills: It’s challenging to wean a population off of comfortable government jobs and generous subsidies. But two years of low oil prices is a reality check for the country.Saudi Arabia’s economic overhaul leans on the hope that non-governmental employment will grow quickly as the kingdom wants to increase the private sector’s contribution from 40 percent to 65 percent of GDP.“They don’t want a country where the government employs two-thirds of their own people,” said McNulty. “The expectation is the private sector will offer better salaries or better career advancement.”Correction: This story was revised to correct that Friedl is managing director for Phoenix Solar Oman.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",pos
"The recent bounce in oil could be creating a rare buying opportunity in a beaten energy name, according to one market watcher.Crude rallied to its highest level since March 1 on Monday after Bank of America and JPMorgan bumped up their forecasts for oil. According to Max Wolff, chief economist at Disruptive Technology, Exxon Mobil could soon reap the benefits.“We like the low cost of capital, we think the dividend play is exciting, and it allows people to take a bit of a foot and shove it deeper into water,” Wolff said Monday on CNBC’s “Power Lunch.”Exxon shares have been on somewhat of a stealth rally of late, surging nearly 10 percent from their August low. The energy giant also sports a dividend yield of 3.7 percent.Wolff warned investors shouldn’t go all-in on the energy space, and crude has seen steep and volatile swings time and time again.“Make sure that this time, it’s for real. There has been a lot of false starts, but still get paid the dividend and still be in somewhat of a defensive name,” he said. “We think this is an interesting space, but there’s a lot of opacity, a lot of political risk ... it’s hard to get super excited about joining the bandwagon now, even though it looks like there’s a little further to go.”Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, is still suspicious of Monday’s rally, even if he agrees that a big oil name like Exxon Mobil could be a good play in the near term.“I’m skeptical about the rally because I think the rally, for the most part, is really due to the weakness in the dollar and the fact that the Saudis have really tried to ramp it above $50 to get [the Saudi Aramco IPO done],” he said.“I think overall, it’s still very much an alternative energy trade in the sense that oil is getting shoved out of the equation more and more as we go forward,” added Schlossberg.The strategist believes that oil could run up to $60, but then investors shouldn’t expect the commodity to break through that level.

"Oil prices are poised to crash to just $10 per barrel over the next six to eight years as alternative energy fuels continue to attract more and more investors, Chris Watling, chief executive of Longview Economics, told CNBC on Friday.When looking ahead to 2018, Watling acknowledged that a key catalyst for the oil market would most likely be Saudi Aramco's initial public offering () in the second half of next year. And when he was asked about Saudi Arabia's state oil group being launched on the international stock market, he replied, ""Well I think they need to get it away quick before oil goes to $10 (per barrel).""While Watling explained that he did not necessarily expect such an intense decline in oil prices over the coming weeks or months, he did argue that over the long term ""what happens with electric vehicles is really, really important"" given that around 70 percent of oil is used for transportation.""We forget don't we? I mean 120 years ago the world didn't live on oil. Oil hasn't always driven the global economy… The point is alternative energy in some forms is gathering speed (and) things are changing,"" he added.The Longview Economics CEO forecast the price of oil would ultimately slump to $10 a barrel over the next six to eight years.On Thursday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said the global outlook for oil markets in 2018 could put a dampener on hopes for higher prices.

"Federated Investors is predicting the stock market is about to give investors a prime buying opportunity, with a beaten-down group leading the way.“We think energy could work here in the back half of the year,”  Phil Orlando, the firm’s chief equity strategist, said Monday on CNBC’s “Trading Nation.” “They [oil and gas companies] have been crushed, and that’s why it’s a very controversial call here.”His comments come as crude oil finds trouble trading above $50 a barrel, a level it hasn’t reached since May. So far this year, the commodity has slid 17 percent.Orlando, whose firm has $360 billion in assets under management, is making his bullish argument on energy based on geopolitics, not technicals.He believes Saudi Arabia will do what it can to push crude oil prices toward at least $60 a barrel as it prepares for its massive Saudi Aramco IPO, its national oil company.Plus, he says Russia also has a big interest in keeping oil prices higher. Its economy must show strength as the country enters a vital presidential election period. The election is scheduled for March.“It would seem as if the potential for upside back into that $50 to $60 neighborhood in the second half of the year could give us some upside in the price of crude and the price of some of these energy stocks,” he added.He doesn’t just see energy propelling the stock market higher.Orlando, who has a 2,500 year-end price target on the  (it closed Monday at 2,427.43), has an 8 percent equity overweight in his portfolio.  “The categories we like are the ones that we think will participate from stronger economic growth and stronger corporate earnings growth — technology, financial services, industrials, materials,” said Orlando.His bullish forecast does come with a caveat.

"– This is the script of CNBC’s news report for China’s CCTV on June 21, Wednesday.Welcome to CNBC Business Daily, I’m Qian Chen.Oil prices fell about 3 percent to seven-month lows on Tuesday after increases in supply by several key producers overshadowed high compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers with a deal to cut global output.The closing level of WTI on Tuesday reached the lowest since Sept. 16, which is more than 20 percent below WTI’s 52-week closing high in February, putting the commodity in bear market territory.Both Brent and WTI, the two oil benchmarks are down about 15 percent since late May, when OPEC, Russia and other producers extended their limits on production until the end of March 2018.OPEC supplies, however, jumped in May as output recovered in Libya and Nigeria, both exempt from the production reduction agreement.Libya’s oil production rose more than 50-thousand bpd to 885-thousand bpd, according to Reuters.Meanwhile, Nigerian oil supply is also rising. Loading programs show that exports of Nigeria’s Bonny Light crude are set to reach 226-thousand bpd in August, up from 164,000 bpd in July.Hedge fund managers have become very bearish about the outlook for oil prices as production from countries outside OPEC grows and threatens to undermine the effectiveness of OPECs output controls. Energy stocks were sold off across the bourse on the lower oil prices.Overnight, S&P engergy index tumbled by 1.25%.Energy giants like Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, Halliburton all closed lower.Now, looking forward, data is the key, according to some analysts.Ahead of weekly U.S. inventory reports, U.S. crude oil stocks were forecast to have fallen for the second straight week, while gasoline supplies were seen unchanged after last week’s data showed an unexpected build that weighed down the market.However, some still hold a relatively bullish view toward a higher oil price by the end of this year.[BILL SMITH, Blaine Capital President and Chief Investment Officer] “I expect oil to be a great deal higher than where it is at the year end.

"Warren Buffett just provided a clear reminder that even at 86 he hasn’t lost his touch. Berkshire Hathaway, the insurance-based conglomerate he runs, is buying up to 38 percent of Canada’s Home Capital and extending it credit of C$2 billion, or about $1.5 billion. It’s a rescue right out of the Omaha investor’s 2008 playbook that promises to steady the troubled mortgage lender. The favorable terms illustrate how his imprimatur is as coveted as his cash.The Canadian company made clear what really mattered. Independent director Alan Roy Hibben said Buffett was chosen over an eyebrow-raising group of 70 other potential suitors because the transaction provided an endorsement “from a world-renowned investor.” Likewise, the first bullet point in the press release emphasizes fame over finance.Home Capital can use all the help it can get. Allegations by Ontario regulators of misleading investors sparked a run by depositors and forced the firm to hastily arrange borrowing capacity on onerous terms. The short-term, high-interest savings accounts Home Capital relied upon for growth have dwindled to just over C$100 million from some C$2 billion in March. Its shares plunged nearly 80 percent.More from Breakingviews: U.S. Senate’s “better” healthcare is still worse  Saudi Aramco IPO is exercise in reverse valuation  China web giants stuck with telco reform bill Buffett’s arrival sent the stock back up 10 percent, an uplift that comes at a cost. Berkshire is buying nearly a fifth of the company at a 36 percent discount to the last closing price. Home Capital is relying on a financial-hardship provision on the Toronto exchange to push the sale through without shareholder approval. And the Oracle of Omaha agreed to acquire more deeply discounted stock to roughly double his ownership stake if Home Capital’s existing owners consent.Assuming his whole investment package goes through, Buffett already has booked a gain, on paper at least, of 65 percent on his C$400 million investment. A juicy interest rate and standby fee on the line of credit would yield roughly another C$200 million a year if fully tapped.Even with the new investor at its side, however, Home Capital faces an uphill climb. The Canadian economy is growing at less than 2 percent annually. Authorities have taken steps to cool off a housing boom and home sales fell 6.2 percent in May.

"Saudi Arabia’s blockade of neighboring Qatar is a distraction as the Arab world’s biggest economy shores up its monarchy and attempts to shift away from reliance on oil exports, according to one analyst.The country’s royal family adjusted its order of secession earlier this week, paving the way for Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman to lead the House of Saud in the future.Salman promotes an “ambitious reform agenda designed to protect … and stabilize the Kingdom after the Arab Spring,” Sanam Vakil, associate fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Programme, told CNBC Thursday.Vakil suggested that Saudi Arabia’s recent diplomatic spat with Qatar, in which the Kingdom and several other Arab countries accused their Gulf neighbor of supporting terrorist groups, was an attempted distraction from “the real challenge at home which is declining oil prices (and) a very young population in need of one thing, jobs, jobs, jobs.”She said that the Kingdom’s smoke and mirrors game was “about the future and protecting the internal stability of the House of Saud.”At the age of 31, Crown Prince Salman is the world’s youngest defense minister. Experience on the international stage, with Saudi Arabia actively involved in conflicts, will prime Salman in his future role as king as “The threat (to stability) is always internal,” said Vakil.Vakil forecast that “We’re going to see much more of a robust and ambitious Saudi Arabia building on a number of events that have already taken place over the past year,” notably U.S. President Donald Trump visiting the Kingdom on his first overseas foreign trip in May.Vakil described Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, its long term project to diversify the economy and move away from dependence on oil, as potentially changing the fabric of the country’s deeply religious Sunni Muslim society. While attempting to generate 1.2 million jobs, “at the same time (the government is) offering the youth fun,” she said. Vakil spoke of the building of cinemas and theme parks, which would “rock the boat a bit, challenging some of the conservative elements within the Kingdom and at the same time reducing subsidies.”Vision 2030′s acknowledgement of the pastoral care of citizens signifies a wider attempt by Gulf countries to “make themselves relevant, and of course to create vibrant societies while enshrining (their) very closed political systems,” Vakil explained.Helima Croft, managing director at RBC Capital Markets, shared Vakil’s view that deliverance on domestic economic reform and creating a swathe of new jobs for young people would be key to Salman’s success.Croft spoke positively to CNBC’s Worldwide Exchange Wednesday of the new leader in waiting. Referring to Salman’s appointment to defense minister in 2015, Croft said that “He has defied all of the skeptics with his staying power.” She also pointed out Salman’s successes with the Vision 2030 project, one example being the expected IPO of Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company.“I think he’s going to be leading Saudi Arabia for the next few decades at this point,” she said.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",pos

"If it weren’t for liquidity right now, the stock market rally could be ripping apart, according to BMO Private Bank’s chief investment officer.“Any sense that this IV drip of liquidity coming into the market is slowing down at all is going to cause some issues,” Jack Ablin said on CNBC’s “Futures Now.”He emphasized that investors have been encouraged to take on risk due to the trillions of dollars being pumped into the financial system by central banks. Ablin’s comments came a day after the Federal Reserve decided to lift short-term interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Even though the rate hike was expected, Ablin admits there was some concern tied to the Fed’s statement. The Fed put in some new wording, saying that it “expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated.”That part left Ablin “a little bit taken aback with the timing,” he said. However, “I think the good news here is, ‘Look, this is a potentially contrived crisis.’ This could be the taper tantrum all over again where [The Fed says] ‘OK, look, we don’t want to cause major upset here. We will continue to pump if equity risk taking takes a hit.’”Ablin said he’s “somewhat optimistic” that the rally will continue. He prefers developed and emerging markets over , arguing that places like Europe could see bigger gains than in the United States because the economy has been surprising experts to the upside.He prefers sectors such as technology, discretionary and materials, but said he’s very bearish on energy, which could ultimately hurt the rally, too.“I was in the camp that oil prices would stay $45 and above just because I felt like Saudi Arabia would sit at home and eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to keep that oil price high in anticipation of the Aramco IPO,” Ablin said. “This last little downtrend is somewhat disturbing because we have reached that 45 number.”Sign-up for the “Futures Now” newsletter here: http://cnb.cx/2mRg7jG",pos

And Saudi Arabic is privatizing, as you know. And the opportunities for US investors, stragetic investors, particular to come in and participate in the process of a very thoughtful, and very effective way is definitely there.""Part of Saudi's Vision 2030 is to have one of the world's top defence companies by 2030 as it seeks to add thousands of manufacturing jobs.The kingdom's sovereign wealth fund established the company to help reduce its reliance on foreign purchases and to diversify the economy away from oil.The Saudi Arabian Military Industries, or Sami, will manufacture products and provide maintenance services across units, including air and land systems, weapons and missiles, and defence electronics, the Public Investment Fund said on Wednesday. The company is wholly owned by the government.Now, in a longer term, Saudi's plan is also to create thousands of jobs in industries, such as tourism and technology.And we are seeing that investment towards technology has taken off already.On Saturday, an investment group that includes Japan's SoftBank and Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth arm announced that it had closed $93 billion in capital, committed to what is expected to be the largest technology investment fund ever.The program also includes the funding of a giant sovereign wealth fund, with the proceeds of the the IPO of state oil company Saudi Aramco, expected sometime next year.CNBC's Qian Chen, reporting from Singapore.",pos
"Despite oil’s negative reaction to the OPEC production cut extension, prices should grind higher into the $60s by the fourth quarter, RBC’s Helima Croft told CNBC on Thursday.Prices plunged after OPEC and other major exporters extended their deal to limit oil production for nine months, disappointing investors who were anticipating deeper output cuts.Brent crude oil dropped 5 percent, or $2.70, to $51.44 a barrel by 3:06 p.m. ET. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended Thursday’s session down 4.8 percent, or $2.46, to $48.90.Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said the extension was a forgone conclusion, but getting a deeper production cut would have been a challenge.She believes continuing the current deal works with the policy priorities of Saudi Arabia, which is focused on the Aramco IPO, and Russia, where President Vladimir Putin is concerned about keeping the Russian population happy and social spending continuing heading into the presidential election next March.“It’s a combination of political and economic priorities coinciding with wanting to have a better technical fundamental outlook for oil,” Croft said in an interview with “Power Lunch.”She sees the floor in oil in the $50s for the last half of the year, with WTI averaging $61 in the fourth quarter.Mike Rothman, head of integrated oil research at Cornerstone Analytics, is also convinced prices will ultimately move higher despite supply coming from the U.S., Libya and Iraq.“When you put everything together, the fact is OPEC’s taking a million and a half a day out of supply from the market since November. That’s 45 million barrels a month,” he told “Power Lunch.”“That to me looks like that’s enough to swing the balance and get us into a much lower inventory level later in 2017.”OPEC announced the agreement to cut oil production in November, but surging U.S. output, weak fuel demand and persistently robust OPEC exports in the first half of the year offset those reductions.— CNBC’s Tom DiChristopher, Matt Clinch and Jackie O’Sullivan contributed to this report.",neg
"OPEC is expected to extend its production deal with Russia and other producers Thursday, a widely anticipated move that should support oil prices but not send them much higher, barring any surprises.Besides the OPEC news Thursday, traders are watching U.S. economic data, Fed speakers and corporate earnings, dominated by retailers like  and  Traders will also be watching for next steps from Washington after the Congressional Budget Office released its scoring of the House GOP’s Obamacare replacement bill.OPEC, at its meeting in Vienna, is expected to extend the agreement to trim production by 1.8 million barrels a day for another nine months, after an initial six-month deal. The extended timing should help the market rebalance, but for Saudi Arabia, in particular, it may help keep prices higher ahead of the IPO of its state-owned Saudi Aramco next year. Higher oil prices would be positive for all oil producers dealing with strained budgets. Oil has been moving higher ahead of the deal. West Texas Intermediate closed at $51.36 per barrel Wednesday after dipping into the $40s recently. There had been speculation that OPEC and others could increase the amount of oil cut from production, but analysts had doubts producers would agree.“It looks like they’re not going to increase it. The initial reaction in the market we think will be supportive. Until you see inventories drop down to reasonable levels, the market is going to have trouble, especially where you have to consider other areas of production coming on line,” said Gene McGillian of Tradition Energy.McGillian noted U.S. production continues to increase, and is at a 2-1/2-year high, while Libya and Nigeria could also increase production.Thursday’s data could have some bearing on the outlook for second quarter GDP, which some economists revised lower Wednesday because of soft housing data.Advanced leading indicators is reported at 8:30 a.m. ET, as are weekly jobless claims. The advanced indicators includes early looks at international trade and inventories which are important for the calculation of GDP growth.“I think it’ll confirm that we’re still at 3.5 percent [Q2 GDP], 3.5 puts a little above 2 percent for the first half,” said Diane Swonk , CEO of DS Economics.Swonk expects 3.6 percent growth for the second quarter, after a weak first quarter, expected to be revised slightly higher to 0.9 percent when an update is released Friday. On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs economists pared back second quarter growth to 3 percent from 3.1 percent.Goldman economists noted the 2.3 percent sales decline in April home sales from March, to 5.57 million units, was still near the March cycle-high. The data followed an 11.4 percent drop in April new home sales on Tuesday. “The recent softening in existing home sales, new home sales, and starts likely reflects the lagged impact of higher mortgage rates,” the economists said.After Wednesday’s Fed minutes signaled the Fed is ready to move on rate hikes as well as start unwinding its balance sheet this year, Fed speakers will also be important to markets.Stocks rose, closing near highs of the day, and Treasury yields slipped after the Fed release.

"  If oil prices are going to rebound, a few countries that have  spent two years trying to edge each other out of crude markets will have to learn to cooperate.Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have suffered serious economic pain as oil prices have languished over the last two years. But OPEC’s largest producers —Saudi  Arabia, Iraq and Iran — as well as nonmember Russia — have all pumped their way through the rout, seeking to  capture more business to offset the falling value of their  lifeblood product.  Their prolific pumping has pushed OPEC’s production to all-time  highs ahead of a meeting next week, where Saudi Arabia will try to  impose output limits on the group’s member countries. The record  output has some analysts questioning whether OPEC can cut deeply  enough to balance an oversupplied global market — especially given  its members’ poor history of sticking to quotas.  Many observers see OPEC’s ability to deliver a serious deal as a referendum on the group’s continuing relevance. That  test comes at a time of profound change in the Middle East.  In Saudi Arabia, an ambitious young prince is spearheading the  kingdom’s efforts to diversify its economy by selling off a share  of the state oil giant Saudi Aramco in order to create a $2 trillion  investment fund. Many OPEC watchers believe that creates an  incentive to boost oil prices so that Saudi Aramco’s IPO looks  more attractive.  Meanwhile, Iran is rebuilding its foreign oil trade after  international powers lifted sanctions on Tehran in January, and  Iraq is fighting to oust Islamic State militants from their  Iraqi stronghold in Mosul. Keeping oil revenue flowing is central  to those endeavors. It’s little surprise, then, that all three countries have been grabbing for more foreign business with both hands.Iraq’s October crude oil exports grew 15.1 percent from a  year ago, while Saudi Arabia’s jumped 6.8 percent. In the same period, tanker loadings from Iran have more than doubled, according to data from tanker-tracking firm ClipperData.  Tehran has made inroads in particular with India, which will be the largest driver of crude oil demand  growth in the coming decades, according to the International  Energy Agency. In October, Iran overtook Saudi Arabia as  India’s top supplier of crude oil.   “They’re clawing some of that market share from others, but  they’re also helping to fill that gap of increasing demand,” said  Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.India purchased much of Iran’s  crude oil before the international community imposed sanctions on  Tehran over its nuclear program. Iran is now winning back that  business, in no small part because its crude is well-suited to  India’s refineries, according to John Kilduff, founding partner  at investment management firm Again Capital.  Reading the data out of China is more difficult, because Beijing  sources its massive crude imports from a wider array of  oil-producing nations. But as erratic as the data are, they tell  an important tale about the nature of the global  crude markets today.  The first part of that story boils down to China’s ability to  dictate pricing. A country’s crude exports may swing widely  from month to month in part because China is able to shop around  for the best price. ClipperData’s figures for the last two years  illustrate this:  Here, the big three OPEC players have to undercut not just one  another, but Latin American and West African players, as well. In  a price downturn where oil producers are scrambling for business,  that works in China’s favor.  “You think that prices dictate flows, but when it comes to China,  it’s such a large part of the market, it’s the other way around.  Their demand dictates prices,” Smith said.  Historically, the Saudis primarily pursued long-term contracts,  but they have recently been playing the spot market, selling from  month to month to try to capture some of China’s short-term demand, Kilduff said.  “They’re getting sharper elbows,” he said. “This price crash has  really changed the landscape in so many ways.”  Competition has only heated up since Russia pivoted to  China and boosted trade ties with Beijing after the European  Union and United States slapped the Kremlin with sanctions over  its meddling in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. But while it’s carving out more share in China, Russia’s dominance in the shrinking European Union market for crude oil is being challenged by Iran. Tehran has quickly ramped up its exports to the EU, and Moscow must now also contend with Libyan oil after the war-wracked nation resumed exports from key ports this year.  OPEC’s surprise shift to a hands-off approach in November 2014  — it previously cut output to boost prices — worsened  the downturn and forced high-cost producers such as U.S.  shale drillers to turn off the tap.  But in a sign that the group’s strategy is coming full circle, Nigeria  has made some room for fellow OPEC producers in Europe by increasing shipments of oil to the United States, where production fell along with oil prices after OPEC refused in 2014 to cut output.“The  lifting of the U.S. export ban meant that WTI [crude oil] came back in line with other global  benchmarks. Combine this with falling production from Bakken  [shale formation], and it became more economical for U.S. East  Coast refiners to import Nigerian crude rather than domestic  crude by rail economics,” Smith said.",neg
"Crude oil prices are being pumped by OPEC’s production cuts, but they are at risk of being knocked down by a gusher of new U.S. shale drilling.OPEC and non-OPEC producers, like Russia, agreed in December to take 1.8 million barrels of crude off the world market. As a result, they have kept the price of oil in the $50s per barrel even with a supply glut, most apparent in the United States. At the same time, U.S. drillers, emboldened by the higher oil price, are drilling at the highest rate in more than a year and look on track to go back to record levels by year-end.All of these principals — the Saudis, other Gulf producers, Russians, Brazilians, Mexicans, big oil and U.S. shale drillers — will meet in Houston starting Monday, Mar. 6,  on panels, at dinners and in the hallways of the annual CERAWeek by IHS Markit energy conference.The question now is who will blink first?OPEC meets again in May and will consider whether to extend the deal. Then there’s Russia, the world’s largest energy producer, which has certainly been helped by price stability but is still feeling the pain wrought by crashing prices.There’s also the U.S. shale industry. It’s no longer a bunch of upstarts, but a cadre of the world’s largest integrated oil producers alongside independent drillers, all eyeing unconventional drilling as a way to get quicker returns with lower costs on shorter horizon projects. The industry also has new vigor, with President Donald Trump setting a pro-hydrocarbon agenda from the White House, encouraging more drilling and construction of energy infrastructure, including the controversial Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines.One of the hottest stories this year is the bounty of the Permian Basin, which runs beneath Texas and New Mexico and offers a new prosperity to the likes of even an Exxon Mobil, which can profit with $40 oil because of technological drilling advances pioneered by the U.S. industry.“This is the push/pull of the market,” said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “I think OPEC is hoping that this remains largely a Permian story. ... That a lot of the cost deflation we saw will rise as prices rise. Service companies will again charge more. There’s a sort of uncertain equilibrium they have to deal with in U.S. production. They hope it will remain largely Permian, but it could get away from them and require deeper cuts. I don’t think the problem is compliance within OPEC, because the Saudis will do what it takes.” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak speaks Monday, and Saudi Arabia energy minister Khalid Al-Falih participates Tuesday.“That was a key relationship for the dialogue they made for this OPEC, non-OPEC agreement, which really hasn’t happened before, and the compliance is higher than it’s been in the past,”  said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. “I think they’re committed to this deal, and that’s one of the main things they want to convey,” Yergin said.Analysts say the real issue is what Saudi Arabia and Russia say about future enforcement and whether they are ready to embrace extension of the six-month production deal in the face of new output from the United States.Saudi Arabia has been shouldering the largest portion of cuts. As the world’s biggest exporter, it is the key driver of OPEC policy, and it’s not clear how much pressure it will take on prices if the United States continues to up production. The United States, in fact, has been producing 9 million barrels a day recently. It has had a number of days this winter where it was exporting record levels of oil, at more than 1 million barrels a day.Some analysts see a collision coming between shale and OPEC if the U.S. industry puts enough oil on the market to push the price below $50.Exxon Mobil chairman and CEO Darren Woods told CNBC this week that OPEC has the lever of low costs, while the unconventional drilling business is driven by economics and market prices. OPEC turned to the new production-driven strategy after a failed plan to let the market set prices. That resulted in oil collapsing into the $20s per barrel after Russia and members of the OPEC kept pumping at record levels.“Well, you’ve seen OPEC make a difference in the market here in the short term. Certainly, the Permian and unconventional play brings a new dimension to the marketplace, and it’s just a question of how OPEC intends to respond to that,” Woods recently told CNBC. “You saw earlier on, their response was to continue to keep production up. The market got oversupplied. Prices came down. They’ve now backed off of that. You see unconventionals coming back up again. I think … the market is still in a bit of discovery, trying to understand how that conventional play fits in with more of the traditional dynamics,” Woods said. Woods speaks at CERAWeek on Monday.Yergin said an issue for the U.S. industry is how long the price of drilling services will remain low, a big factor in helping drilling ramp up after prices and activity fell sharply.OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo also speaks at the conference, on Tuesday. He is the relatively new head of OPEC, which has resurrected itself with its new strategy after being declared “dead” and “irrelevant” by many in the market as it let the price of oil crash early last year.“Barkindo, he’s like the whip of OPEC,” Croft said. “There are stories of Barkindo going to these capitals and trying to drive compliance. He drove the deal home. He’s the one really forcing compliance. He knows he needs to talk to the heads of state rather than the oil ministers. He’s a skilled operator.”Yergin said he also expects to hear the Saudi Arabian energy minister discuss the IPO of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company. Saudi Arabia plans to offer shares in Aramco as a way to raise funds to diversify away from oil, as part of Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 reform program.“Kahlid is the big brand ambassador for Vision 2030. … He’s like ‘minster everything,’” Croft said. “He’s the big seller of the Aramco IPO. He’ll double down on the Vision 2030, and he’ll reaffirm Saudi commitment to the reformation plan.”Other speakers at CERAWeek include Sultan Ahmed al Jaber, minister of state, United Arab Emirates, who speaks Monday. The Iraqi oil minister, Jabbar Ali Al-Luiebi; and Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, energy minister of UAE, speak Tuesday. Also participating are the CEOs of ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Chesapeake Energy, BP, Continental Resources, PEMEX, Total and Occidental Petroleum, among others. The five-day conference also features Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a speaker Thursday evening.Other topics on the agenda include global LNG, nuclear generation and U.S. natural gas and its markets.

"Samer Khoury is not a diplomat, which makes his self-assigned mission of restoring the little town of Bethlehem that much harder.Despite incredible odds against violent protests in the wake of President Donald Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, this businessman has been able to attract the support from heavyweight patrons of all faiths, including Theodore McCarrick, the archbishop emeritus of Washington; Prince Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, a senior member of the royal family of Saudi Arabia; and, more controversially, Sheikh Muhammad A.

The GDP per capita in the West Bank and Gaza is $4,300. Bethlehem remains a poor city, where some families live in one-room homes and many young people lack jobs.Khoury’s work and the life for the people of Bethlehem are harder now in the wake of the announcement in early December by Trump that the United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. The announcement, which failed to mention east Jerusalem as the capital of an eventual Palestinian state — a long-hoped-for outcome by moderates in the Arab world — sparked violent protests across the Middle East. In Bethlehem, tourism has slowed to a trickle, and there have been some protests there, too.“What we sell is the Christian spirit and the message of hope and peace,” Khoury said.He worries about what the next weeks and months will bring. “History has told us when something starts no one knows the end game in this part of the world,” he said.Fractured politics mirror the fractured religions: The main attraction in Bethlehem is the Church of the Nativity, said to the be birthplace of Jesus. It has been governed for centuries by three denominations whose defense of their “zones” in the church is legendary and has sometimes come to blows: the Franciscan order of Roman Catholics, the Greek Orthodox Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church.“They are not businesspeople,” said Khoury, sounding pained, recounting the difficulties of getting the lights strung to decorate the church at Christmas.But, moved by his family’s Greek Orthodox and Palestinian roots, Khoury has a new vision for Bethlehem: Within 10 years, he wants to see 3 million tourists a year thronging the narrow streets. Three years in, he said, “We’re 5 percent to 10 percent there.”Khoury’s late father, Said, founded the Bethlehem Development Foundation, a nonprofit that has so far spent about $40 million, with projects underway to further restore the church, build playgrounds for children and buy buses to ferry tourists to sites in and around the town. The foundation also incorporated a fundraising nonprofit in the United States and plans a Washington dinner in early February. It aims to raise and spend $60 million more by 2027. “It’s a sad city when you enter,” said Khoury. “This is the center of Christianity, important for 2 billion people. My father said: ‘It is going to be a ghetto if nobody does anything.’”Khoury, who picked up the reins after his father died in 2014, wants to do everything from spur tourism with a new hotel and new agreements with Israeli bus companies, to helping develop jobs-training programs for students at a local university.The streets of Bethlehem are lined with tiny shops, many selling olive wood trinkets and beautifully carved nativity sets, but they are struggling. Bassem Giacaman, one of the shopkeepers, said before the second intifada, his shop had revenue of $400,000 a year, and employed 12. Now, it brings in about $100,000 a year, enough to employ three people and earn him a tiny profit, perhaps $10,000. In the two weeks since Trump’s announcement, only three people have visited his shop, and he doesn’t know how he will pay his workers, he said. Still, he said, he wants to keep his family’s workshop alive because he loves the Church of the Nativity. In 1948, the Christian population of the Holy Land was 18 percent; it’s now 2 percent, according to the Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation.Giacaman has tried to make his shop welcoming for everyone: It carries menorahs, Nativity sets, Arabic calligraphy — and welcomes tourists who need to use the toilet. “We just try to open the door and keep things going,” he said.Khoury said he was in part inspired to continue his father’s work when he talked to people like Giacaman. The foundation, with the initial donation of $30 million from the Khourys in 2011, is helping the Palestinian government manage the much-lauded restoration of the church. It also has helped refurbish Manger Square, where tourist buses park, start a small museum and finance a strategic solid waste management plan for the area. Among its long-term plans: a small shopping center and car park, a solar power station that could power small factories, and a small hotel of about 100 rooms.More from Global Investing Hot Spots: Who will win the world’s biggest IPO? A $100 billion global arms race Trump wants to win Saudi Aramco taps JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley for IPO; HSBC a contender Some of the projects may be funded via investments — he said some projects could yield 10 percent annually — and some via donations.Though between 1 million and 2 million people visit the church every year – exact numbers are hard to come by – few stay overnight and little economic benefit comes to the town of about 25,000 people.Khoury’s late father was a Greek Orthodox Palestinian who immigrated to Lebanon, founded CCC, and then moved it to Greece. “He was a true believer,” Samer Khoury said of his father.CCC, now run by his three sons, has about 100,000 employees worldwide and had revenue of $5.3 billion in 2016, Khoury said. It builds projects of enormous scale: CCC builds or is a partner on projects such as the giant 60-kilometer Riyadh Metro in Saudi Arabia, a giant expo center in Kazakhstan, and — in the near future — oil platforms off the East Africa, Khoury said. CCC is a part owner of the power plant in Gaza, the southern part of the Palestinian territory.In Bethlehem, the scale of projects is much smaller. Sometimes, in the complicated politics of the town, the goals can get tripped up by something as small as a string of lights.For instance, stringing lights on the Church of the Nativity opened a fraught negotiation between the three denominations. An extra light hanging on the wrong side of a wall might have been taken as a sign one of the denominations had ceded territory in the church to another. In the Church of the Nativity, the walls, the windows and even a crack in the floor are claimed by one of the three. “It is funny,” said Khoury, without laughing even a little bit. “It is not practical.”He is a little frustrated, but he is not giving up.Though there are many nonprofits and aid agencies working in Bethlehem, Khoury’s effort is different, observers said, because of its breadth, Khoury’s business acumen, the money behind it and the expertise CCC is putting to the task.“What Samer Khoury has developed is an entire mechanism to restore and rebuild Bethlehem; a city whose international reputation precedes it but whose infrastructure, and most importantly, its people have been neglected for far too long. (He) is working … to bring hope back to the city’s inhabitants,” said Sir Rateb Rabie, CEO of the Holy Land Christian Ecumenical Foundation and a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre, named by the pope for services in the Holy Land.The Bethlehem Development Foundation has an engineer working in Bethlehem on restoration of the church, which started three years ago and will probably last three or four more years, Khoury says.Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas first persuaded the three denominations to allow the restoration, but Khoury’s foundation stepped in to manage payments for the highly specialized contractors doing the work, which has included replacing the 500-year-old wooden roof. Now, the restoration is moving on to restoring beautiful golden icons on the walls and an ancient mosaic under the floor that tourists tramp over on their way into the grotto said to mark the birthplace of Jesus.Among the discoveries during the restoration: a hole left from a stray bomb that fell during the 1967 War.The difficulties of existing in Bethlehem, which lies just beyond the wall that separates Israel from the Palestinian territories have defeated big companies. The InterContinental Hotels Group, for instance, withdrew its contract with the Jacir Palace Hotel in Bethlehem after a series of stabbings in Israel and retaliations in the West Bank. Tourists generally travel through Israel and come via buses from Israeli touring companies, which drive in and out of the town, headed to more developed destinations on the Israeli side, as rapidly as they can. The GDP per capita in Israel is $34,800 a year.Khoury is unfazed. “This is Israel and Palestine,” he said. “You have to expect that.”He believes that if Bethlehem had more to offer tourists, their numbers would grow, and they would stay and spend more money. Both Israel and the Palestinian territories are seen as tourism markets with enormous untapped potential. For instance, in 2010, a comparison between Israel and Jordan found the former got about 2.8 million in tourists, compared with Jordan’s 4.5 million. About 648,000 Americans visited Israel in 2016, up 5 percent from the previous record year.Khoury remains hopeful. To cope with the complicated politics of the region, and the complicated religious politics, Khoury assembled an board of heavyweight patrons of many faiths.Khoury said he invited two Jewish board members and hopes to have one join this year.To raise more money for Bethlehem, Khoury is turning to wealthy individuals, especially those with roots in Palestine. “It is like with any start-up, you need a track record,” he said. “We have that now.”On his list of targets: Carlos Slim, the Mexican billionaire whose father was from Lebanon. Khoury said he’ll find many people willing to help. Donations have already begun coming, such as a $1.2 million gift from the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, he said.“I made a big list. These people, like our family, have connections to Palestine and have succeeded.”He’s convinced the story of Bethlehem will attract givers. He paused, unexpectedly poetic for a businessman. “My song that I sing, I bring many people along,” he said.— By Elizabeth MacBride, special to CNBC.com",pos
"The stock market may be signaling something is awry in the oil market.Like a seesaw, oil prices have gone up in February, while energy stocks have gone down. Matt Maley of Miller Tabak Securities says the action in crude oil creates a “conundrum.”“Energy stocks usually lead crude oil ... so if history is any guide, the decline in the XLE should be telling us that the recent bounce in WTI is not going to last,” Maley said in a recent note.The Energy Select Sector SPDR fund (XLE) is down more than 5 percent in one month, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures are up almost 2.5 percent. Energy is the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 over the same time period, logging a near 6 percent loss.Still, investors have been piling into crude futures and traders say there aren’t really signs of a pending correction. But the buying by speculative traders in oil futures has created the biggest net ‘long’ position in history, signaling that if there is a break in prices, investors running for the exits could cause some calamity in the market.“The Commitment of Traders data shows that the ‘specs’ are loaded to the gills in crude oil — they have their largest net long position ever. Similarly, the ‘commercials’ have their largest net short positions ever,” Maley notes.He also indicates that the specs tend to be wrong when the commercials tend to be right.“I think there are two different “agendas” allowing for the open interest to hit a record,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Associates. “At these price levels, the specs are more inclined to enter the oil market on the long side as they feel we just won’t go below $30 as world demand keeps rising.”The factors supporting crude at the moment include OPEC’s production cut, a possible Saudi Aramco IPO, and seasonal demand starting to pick up in the United States.The downside factors include U.S. shale producers aggressively pumping, and the potential for a producer like Russia to not keep up with compliance with the OPEC deal. So far, both OPEC and non OPEC seem to be complying with the plan to hold 1.8 million barrels a day off the world market, so that prices stabilize.“The big bet is that OPEC/non-OPEC complies with the cuts and inventory draws. If over the next few months inventory surveys show little in the way of confirming the cuts, back to the mid $40s we go,” Lipow said.In December, Russia surpassed Saudi Arabia as the largest producer at roughly 10.5 million barrels a day. U.S. production is coming back strong, with the government’s weekly report showing U.S. crude production was back at 9 million barrels a day last week, a level not seen since April of 2016.Even though the market hasn’t been that kind to energy stocks of late, the industry is making a big bet on stock prices holding up. Estimates suggest that the market could see as many as 40 IPOs launch this year. If that number of deals comes to market, it would be triple the deal flow of 2016.Deals are expected across energy sub sectors. Everything from producers, to pipelines, to frackers, a group that faced particular hardship as oil prices got close to $26 a barrel in February last year.But these energy deals are contingent upon crude over $50. Right now, Wall Street analysts are split. This week, Citi said crude could hit $70, while ANB warned that WTI could fall closer to $30 if OPEC does not follow through.While $30 is not what most analysts expect, the movements in the XLE would suggest a re-test of a sub-$50 price might not be as far off as some would think.",neg

"  Saudi Arabia wrangled OPEC ministers into a tougher-than-expected  oil production deal — a maneuver critical for its own long-term plans.Wednesday's deal comes as Saudi Arabia is trying to remake its oil-dependent economy into one that is more diversified, under a plan  it calls Vision 2030. A higher oil price would help boost  revenues at a time when it has been running deficits and  borrowing.  ""They need a decent oil price, and they need to maintain market  share. Part of the great irony of Vision 2030 is that in order to  diversify the Saudi economy away from oil, they need to sell  oil,"" said IHS Markit Vice Chairman Daniel Yergin.  The kingdom steered OPEC on Wednesday to cut back on the oil spigot in order to boost prices. All producers have been  struggling with a bruising cycle that has strained budgets and  hampered their ability to reinvest in energy infrastructure. The  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day, bringing output to 32.5 million barrels a day.Additionally, OPEC said non-OPEC producers are also expected to contribute with  a 600,000-barrels-per-day reduction, including a surprise 300,000  barrels a day cut by Russia. Saudi Arabia would trim just 486,000  barrels a day, about 300,000 less than expected.""The Saudis really pulled off a victory for themselves ... I  think that the most recent sell-off in crude oil scared them all  into this. I think they saw what lay ahead if they didn't do  this,"" said John Kilduff, founder of investment firm Again Capital.   Higher oil prices should also be a plus for the expected initial  public offering next year of state-owned oil company Saudi  Aramco, a pillar of the kingdom's plan to create a huge sovereign  wealth fund. The world's largest oil exporter is hoping to  diversify into areas such as technology, mining and tourism.  Saudi Arabia may have pushed for the current OPEC deal, but it was  also the main force behind the cartel's November 2014 decision to  abandon OPEC's long-running policy of using output as a lever to control prices. It  instead let the market set prices, in an effort to stem the  growth of high-cost production, especially U.S. shale.  That strategy resulted in OPEC and other producers pumping record  amounts of oil, which ultimately drove prices into the $20s per  barrel this year.   Saudi officials have been vocal about their concerns that low oil  prices make it difficult to reinvest in exploration and  production, and that they ultimately could create a supply shortage  when demand starts to rise.  ""I think the Saudi minister has been very explicit now for over a  year, warning that the underinvestment could lead to a fly up in  prices before the end of the decade, and that is something they  don't want to see. They recognize that low prices are a big  problem, but so are high prices — if you're a long-term  supplier — because it erodes demand and encourages alternatives,""  said Yergin.  Michael Cohen, head of energy commodities research at Barclays,  said Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih mentioned the  industry's need to increase capital expenditures in his remarks in Vienna on Wednesday.  ""At the end of the day, what Saudi Arabia is worried about is they  wanted to get the engine started on investment. They don't see it  starting when oil is at $35 to $45,"" he said.   The agreement to cut production comes at the end of a year of  failed efforts, and several days of high drama between  producers, who quibbled over how much cutting each would  contribute in order to rein in the global oil glut. West Texas  Intermediate oil futures plunged Tuesday, and then rallied 9  percent Wednesday in response to the accord. Whether the proposed  deal works remains to be seen, but even the semblance  of an agreement is expected to be positive for  prices.   ""There was a lot of overnight diplomacy. That was the turning  point. The skeptics in the room needed to see the numbers. It  looks like the Saudis drove the hardest bargain on specificity.  They knew what the market needed, and they pushed it through,""  said Helima Croft, head of global commodities strategy at RBC.      ""I think even the requirement for non-OPEC (nations) is really about the  Saudis looking for the most credible statement they could get. I  think they understood there was so much skepticism in the  market,"" she said.  Saudi Arabia's reform effort is being led by  31-year-old Deputy Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman, the favorite son of King Salman.  Croft said the OPEC oil deal should help the country's reform program, as  it could alleviate economic pressure and buy the young  prince some time. The kingdom has cut back on entitlements, subsidies  on things like fuel, and even on salaries.  ""They risk popular backlash. This will be a popular decision in  Saudi Arabia, and it gives Mohammed bin Salman some breathing  room,"" she said.   But stability in the market could bring back the very competitors  OPEC was trying to stop. The U.S. industry in the last decade  shocked the world when it used new shale-based technologies and  horizontal drilling to suddenly boost oil production. When OPEC  unleashed its market-based strategy in 2014, the U.S. had added  4 million barrels a day of production in just six years.  According to U.S. government data, the U.S. produced 8.7 million  barrels a day last week, about a million barrels a day below its  peak in spring of 2015.   ""The problem is Saudi Arabia is really testing the elasticity of  shale, and they've been testing the elasticity of shale for the  last two years, the new source of supply. If their actions lead  to an increase in the price to a band of $50 to $60, what kind of  shale response would we get? Nobody knows the answer to that  question. Their foreign exchange reserve continues to tick lower.  They have Vision 2030. The war on Yemen is continuing, and they  have the Aramco IPO, and higher prices are conceptually a better  platform for all of those things — the Yemen war,  Vision 2030 and the IPO,"" said Cohen.  He said Saudi Arabia viewed U.S. shale growth of 1 million to 1.5  million barrels a day as disruptive. ""They weren't comfortable  with that level of growth, and who is to say they won't be  comfortable with 200,000 to 300,000? That's what we expect — 200,000 barrels a day of growth from the lower 48"" states in 2017, Cohen said.",pos
"  Iraq’s insistence that it should be exempt from a proposed deal  to limit oil output may sound audacious coming from OPEC’s second  largest producer, but analysts say it’s entirely possible that top exporter Saudi Arabia will give Baghdad a pass.  Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi dropped the bombshell on  Sunday, doubling down after Iraq had already kicked up a fuss  over how OPEC plans to set quotas when it meets next month in  Vienna. He argued that his country can’t cut production because  it badly needs oil revenue to fight the Islamic State, which  Iraqi forces are now fighting to dislodge from Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city and ISIS’s last stronghold in Iraq.Crude output from Iraq has risen steadily as OPEC members battle for market share amid a two-year oil price rout. Iraq pumped at 4.45 million barrels per day in September, according to secondary sources.  To be sure, Iraq has traditionally been exempt from OPEC quotas, on the grounds that its economy has labored beneath the weight of  war in recent years and sanctions before that. Still, Iraq’s call to be exempt has helped to send oil prices below $50 a barrel this week and overshadowed supportive comments from Iranian and  Russian officials regarding efforts to secure cuts from non-OPEC  producers.   Iraq is “absolutely” stuck between a rock and hard place, said  Bilal Wahab, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East  Policy. Its economic situation is so bad, it cannot afford to cut  oil production, but it is also desperate for the relief that  higher oil prices would likely bring.  For that reason, the Iraqi oil minister’s comments should not be taken as a mere bluff ahead of a high stakes meeting, say  analysts.   “I think the argument is serious. It’s not just saber-rattling.  The Iraqi economy is in shambles, as is the Kurdish economy, and  the war effort adds to the burden,” said Wahab, referring to the  semi-autonomous area known as Iraqi Kurdistan.  This summer, the International Monetary Fund floated Iraq a $5.3 billion loan to help Baghdad weather reforms aimed at  tackling oil’s prolonged price slump and  an ISIS insurgency that has displaced 4 million people. At the time,  the IMF said Iraq’s government, which relies on oil for roughly 90  percent of its revenue, faced a $18 billion funding gap.  That deficit threatens to further undermine an already unstable  nation by making it difficult for Baghdad and the Kurdish capital  of Erbil to deliver basic services, pay public workers, and  compensate international oil companies.  It’s not only state finances standing in the way of Iraqi  participation in an OPEC cut, but also the often contentious  relationship between the central government in Baghdad and the  Kurdish leadership in Iraq’s northeast. In doing a deal with  OPEC, Baghdad runs the risk that the Kurds would just refuse to go along with their own oil fields, leaving the Shiite Muslim south to  bear the financial burden of production caps and potentially  inflaming already deep divisions over revenue-sharing, according  to Wahab.  A production cut would be a hard sell to the Kurds, who have long  sought an independent homeland carved out of parts of Iraq,  Turkey and Syria, and who are fiercely protective of their autonomy  within Iraq.  “The Kurdish government has been really working hard and ... at  huge cost to maintain this level of oil independence, and one of  the challenges of saying yes to Baghdad is losing that  independence they have achieved,” he said.Amid the call to be exempt, the Iraqi oil ministry also launched an effort to attract foreign companies to develop a dozen small and mid-sized oil fields.Saudi Arabia has already signaled it may exempt Libya, Nigeria and Iran from production  quotas because those countries are restoring sidelined capacity. Libya and  Nigeria’s output has tanked due to internal conflicts, while Iran  is clawing back market share after sanctions on Tehran were  lifted this year.  Unlike Iran, which has a more diverse economy than Iraq and  enjoys relative domestic stability, the Iraqis simply need higher  oil prices, said Helima Croft, head of commodity strategy at RBC  Capital Markets.    “Here’s the problem for Iraq, and this is where they could push  it too far,” she told CNBC. “The Iranians are in a financial  position to walk away. The Iraqis don’t have a major slug of  product coming on.”  “It would be one thing if the Iraqis had 500,000 barrels up their  sleeve that they could put on the market,” she added.  But the fact that Iraq does not have hundreds of thousands of  barrels a day it can suddenly bring online could serve as a  weapon as much as it presents a weakness. Since Saudi Arabia  doesn’t fear Iraq will suddenly ramp up production while others  are cutting, Riyadh could be willing to extend some sort of  special treatment to Baghdad, Croft said.  “They would prefer Iraq to stay in the tent of doing something.  This is where it’s going to be a bit of a push and pull, but I  don’t think anyone is incentivized to have this thing blow up,”  she said.  Riyadh is aiming to sell a stake in state oil giant Saudi  Aramco in order to fund a $2 trillion  sovereign wealth fund designed to diversify the Saudi  economy. A rising oil price would make the IPO more attractive to  investors.  Still, the OPEC deal simply won’t work if Iraq does not  participate in some form, said Richard Mallinson, geopolitical  analyst at research firm Energy Aspects. In his view, no one is expecting Iraq  to make big cuts, but Baghdad and its OPEC peers must at least  address the dispute over how the cartel measures baseline  production.Immediately after the OPEC deal was announced last month, Iraq  insisted the quotas should be based on current production figures  supplied by Baghdad, rather than secondary sources that reflect  lower Iraqi output. Striking an agreement could be tricky, with  most of OPEC united around output levels provided by secondary  sources, but with Iraq insisting cuts be measured against its own, higher figures, Mallinson said.“Nobody in the market really agrees with those numbers that  Baghdad is putting out, and so I think there’s going to be some  difficult diplomacy behind the scenes between now and the 30th of  November to try and get Baghdad singing from the same sheet as  the other producers,” Maillinson told CNBC’s “Street Signs” on  Monday.",pos
"  Saudi Arabia is still preoccupied with defending its market share  even though its oil minister said producers may discuss taking  action to prop up crude prices next month, analyst Dan  Yergin said Friday.  Oil markets rallied Thursday on Energy Minister Khalid  al-Falih’s comments.Analysts have  said Saudi Arabia could play ball with other producers despite rejecting an agreement to freeze output in April after regional  rival Iran said it would keep pumping until it returned to  pre-sanctions production levels.   That is because the Saudis now have a larger stake in the  long-term oil price as Prince Mohammed bin Salman seeks to diversify the  economy by launching an IPO for a stake in state oil giant  Saudi Aramco and turning the country’s Public Investment Fund  into a $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund.  Al-Falih confirmed that producers  will gather on the sidelines of a meeting in Algeria next month  to discuss the rebalancing of oil markets following a two-year  rout that has seen crude prices plummet from more than $100 a  barrel in 2014 to the upper $20s this past winter.  But Yergin said protecting Saudi share of the oil market still  trumps propping up prices in the eyes of the kingdom’s policymakers.  Indeed, in OPEC’s latest monthly report out earlier this week,  Saudi Arabia reported it was pumping crude at record levels.  “I think the pre-eminent thing is about maintaining market share,”  Yergin told CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”  Still, he added, energy-producing nations may be able to  come to an agreement as they reach the upward limits of their  capacity to churn out crude. Still, while Iran is nearing  capacity, striking a deal will be difficult, said  Yergin, IHS Markit vice chairman.  Oil markets are moving into recovery phase as U.S. producers have  decreased production by about 1.2 million barrels per day from a  modern-day peak in April 2015, Yergin said. The Saudi-engineered  policy of maintaining high production has squeezed American  drillers whose costs are higher due to their reliance on  hydraulic fracturing, the process of pummeling shale rock with  water, minerals and chemicals to free oil and natural gas.  While commodity watchers have focused on the response from U.S.  shale producers as they await signs of market balance, Yergin  cautioned that the postponement of “big, megaprojects” around the  world that typically take five to seven years to complete is  jeopardizing the industry’s ability to meet future demand.  “You see postponements, delays and cancellations, so you’re going  to see as supply-demand balance that’s going to be different over  the next couple of years,” he said. “The question now is of  course struggling with price, but in three, four, five years, how  are we going to meet 5 or 6 million barrels a day of new demand  growth?”",neg
"  Just the whiff of an OPEC meeting has driven oil prices higher,  squeezed shorts in the futures market — and made further inaction by the cartel more likely.  But that hasn’t stopped market chatter that the Organization of  Petroleum Exporting Countries could revisit the idea of a production freeze  when it meets informally on the sidelines of an energy conference  in Algeria late next month.  Oil’s recent dip back into the $30s per barrel may be enough to  get some OPEC members to curb their bickering and consider joint  action — if crude plummets again. But for now, analysts see  the cartel just talking, with the more needy members pushing for  relief through a freeze or other deal.",pos
" – This is the script of CNBC’s news report for China’s CCTV on January 27, Wednesday.Welcome to CNBC Business Daily, I’m Qian Chen. Global oil and gas prices will remain weak in 2016 on continued oversupply that will result in at least 20-25% reduction in capital spending in upstream oil and gas exploration and production, according to a report published by Moody’s. RAVI KRISHNASWAMY, VP of Energy & Power Systems from Frost & Sullivan, told CNBC that the following 3 factors are behind this year’s energy weakness. Factor 1: Supply glut that is likely to worsen, before getting better - Rising global inventories (VO-Saudi Aramco)- Saudi Arabia will continue to pump. Aramco IPO to help Saudi Arabia sustain prolonged low prices (hence more supply) - Iranian supply - 50 million barrels stored capacity, potential 600k-1 million barrels extra to global markets which will more than offset shale loss - Shale producers have managed better than anticipated - Who will blink first - seems to be less powerful ones like Nigeria, Venezuela, Canada than Saudi, Russia or US CLN CAP CON 01_27_2016 1300 [RAVI KRISHNASWAMY Frost & Sullivan VP, Energy & Power Systems, Asia Pacific ] “133655 I think US shale has seen the economy dropping, obviously that is a gradual process but the blinking will not be OPEC as a bloc but will be individual countries in the OPEC, could be Vernezuela, could be Nigeria, could be Algeria, one of those, it’s not going to be a bloc, i think the OPEC bloc has pretty much gone out. 133712”Factor 2: Slackening global demand, amidst lack of economic growth catalyst - Global demand growth for oil likely to fall from 1.7 million barrels/day to 1.2 million barrels/day, with a lower daily consumption average of 95.7 million/day - China Factor - moving away from export driven model to domestic consumption led growth, new normal of single digit GDP growth, China accounted for almost half of growth in energy demand so far in 21st century (which will not be the case moving forward), broader focus on improving energy efficiency across sectors - India - GDP growth not enough to absorb the global surplus - Lack of global catalyst - China and emerging markets woes, No visible accelerator for commodities, No dot com boom etc. - Climate change concerns and green growth will suppress oil demand CLN CAP CON 01_27_2016 1300 [RAVI KRISHNASWAMY Frost & Sullivan VP, Energy & Power Systems, Asia Pacific] “133529 In a situation like this, that’s what you will expect, you’ll expect consumer sentiment to go up. of course in the US autosales have gone up, probably that’s a small part of the market that is picking up but i don’t think we are seeing it anywhere else in a big way. I think the emerging markets are complete down, Russia down, Brazil is down, China is kind of wobbling, India is the only that has bright spots but this is because of other issues like the rural economy, I think the urban economy is good but the rural economy’s growth has not been tackled up to the level which is a big concern. 133602 ”Factor 3: New geopolitical reality - Loss of OPEC clout - US oil exports - Growing Saudi-China relationship. Saudis looking towards China to help non-oil diversification of economy - US-Iran relationship. Again changing the dynamics in Middle East - Impact of terrorism and security concerns on trade CNBC’s Qian Chen, reporting from Singapore.   Follow us on Twitter: @CNBCWorld",pos
"  For the next U.S. president, no foreign policy choice will be more important than deciding whether and how to end a stalemate of conflict in the Middle East.  The challenges will be daunting.  But turning a blind eye to the region's deteriorating realities will ensure that the dangers and threats only grow.     Terrorist attacks in the past weeks claiming hundreds of lives in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey underscore that the fundamental dynamics of instability and conflict persist.  Russia has emerged as a regional and complicating force. Syria's crisis has grown more acute.  Iran will entrench further in Syria. Iraq is challenged to hold together as a state. ISIS has spread its reach of terror as territorial claims to a caliphate slip out of its hands.     The consequences flow far beyond the Middle East.  Fear of Syrian refugees tipped frustration with EU bureaucracy into a Leave victory in the UK.  Nationalist parties have surged (again) in Austria and France. ISIS sponsored the recent carnage in Bangladesh and potentially inspired the massacre in Orlando.     World-wide, energy consumers will likely pay as well - with the return of a risk premium to the price of oil.  A global oversupply since 2014 erased the market impact of political risk. ISIS' advance on Baghdad two years ago sent prices spiraling up. But, more recently, ISIS attacks in Baghdad, Paris, Egypt, Turkey, the United States, and Belgium did not raise oil prices.    This insulation of oil prices from risk volatility is bound to change now that oil demand growth will outstrip growth in supply in the next year.  No one can predict the range of volatility, but we can predict that the politics of oil will become more acute when consumers pay more at the pump.     Whomever the victor in the U.S. elections, the next administration must put geopolitical shrewdness ahead of self-affirming rhetoric if it wants to change the balance of forces driving the downward spiral of conflict in the Middle East. Here are six realities that a President Clinton or Trump will have to face and redress:    If we assess these realities starkly and with objectivity, we can extract lessons that the next occupant of the White House should consider:     Brexit and the lives lost in terrorist attacks from Paris to Brussels to Dhaka should be reminders enough that terror and instability in the Middle East are not just a Middle East problem.  From oil prices to security we are affected in every nation.  The next U.S. President needs to be ready to act on the region's challenges.

"U.S. stock futures were pointing to a lower open Tuesday, adding to Monday’s sell-off that broke the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s eight-session winning streak. Stocks held up pretty well Monday, considering the big spike in oil after Saturday’s attacks on Saudi crude facilities. U.S. oil prices, after surging nearly 14.7% on Monday, were dropping about 1.5% Tuesday to about $62 per barrel. J.P. Morgan’s chief quant said crude prices won’t hurt stock prices unless they hit the $80 to $85 per barrel range. As the Federal Reserve begins its two-day September meeting Tuesday, market expectations for no interest rate cut were rising from near zero particularly last week to about 34% odds.Satellite photos released by the U.S. government and DigitalGlobe reveal the surgical precision with which Saudi Aramco’s oil facilities were attacked early Saturday. The strikes, which unidentified U.S. officials have said involved at least 20 drones and several cruise missiles, forced Saudi Arabia to shut down half its oil production, representing about 5% of the world’s global daily output. President Donald Trump said Monday it’s looking like Iran was responsible but he’s in no rush to respond militarily to the attack.With Washington looking at Tehran for the attack on Saudi Arabia, Iran’s supreme leader said Tuesday his country will never hold talks with America. Those comments come ahead of U.N. General Assembly meetings this week and next. Speculation surrounding talks between the U.S. and Iran began when Iran’s foreign minister met with European diplomats at the G-7 summit in France last month. Trump has voiced his willingness to talk with the Iranians several times, but Iranian officials have demanded that sanctions be lifted first.Trump is making a rare visit to California, a Democratic stronghold where he’s expected to rake in millions of dollars during a series of reelection fundraisers. The president’s visit Tuesday and Wednesday signals that despite the state’s decidedly leftward swing, plenty of wealthy Republicans support his reelection bid. Trump continues to rake in tons of cash more than a year out from the November 2020 election, with his campaign and the Republican National Committee pulling in more than $210 million this year, Federal Election Commission records show. That’s more than the combined total that all the Democrats seeking to replace him have raised.After a series of setbacks and a massive valuation cut, the parent company of WeWork is delaying plans for its initial public offering. The U.S. office-sharing start-up was getting ready to launch an investor road show for its IPO this week, before making the last-minute decision on Monday to stand down, sources told Reuters. The company was concerned that its stock market debut would be snubbed by many investors. SoftBank, WeWork’s biggest outside investor, had been reportedly pushing to shelve the IPO.— AP and Reuters contributed to this report.",pos
"Dow and S&P 500 futures were pointing to a higher Monday open on Wall Street, adding to two straight weeks of gains. With August, the second down month of the year, in the rearview mirror, the Dow stands about 2% away from its July all-time highs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were, respectively, 1.6% and 2.8% off their July record highs. Aside from volatility over the U.S.-China trade war, investors are looking ahead to Thursday’s policy meeting of the European Central Bank and next week’s gathering of Federal Reserve policymakers. Easier monetary measures are expected from both central banks.Bond yields were moving higher Monday morning, adding to a September rebound on optimism about next month’s U.S.-China trade talks. In the era of market-moving tweets from President Donald Trump, largely about China trade and the Federal Reserve lately, J.P. Morgan created an index to track the impact of Trump’s tweets on the bond market. The bank said its index found a measurable fraction of the moves in implied rate volatility for 2-year and 5-year Treasurys. The J.P. Morgan officials behind the index said that such a dynamic makes sense since the president has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates again as the U.S.-China trade war puts pressure on the global economy.China’s exports unexpectedly fell in August as shipments to the U.S. slowed sharply, pointing to further weakness in the world’s second-largest economy and underlining a pressing need for more stimulus as the trade tensions escalate. Beijing is widely expected to announce more support measures in coming weeks to avert the risk of a sharper economic slowdown as the United States turns up tariff pressure. On Friday, China’s central bank reduced so-called bank reserve requirements for a seventh time since early 2018 to free up more funds for lending.Apple, a day ahead of its annual iPhone launch, is addressing a report alleging the U.S. tech giant and its manufacturing partner Foxconn violated a Chinese labor law that says temporary hires cannot exceed 10% of the total workforce. “We looked into the claims by China Labor Watch and most of the allegations are false,” Apple said in a statement. Foxconn confirmed that a review of its operations in Zhengzhou “did identify some workforce compliance issues.” Apple did not disclose which of the allegations may be true.J.P. Morgan Chase is close to winning the lead advisory role for the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, the world’s most profitable corporation, edging out rivals for the plum assignment, people with knowledge of the situation told CNBC’s Hugh Son. A final decision is expected next week and could still change, the people said. Morgan Stanley, which had been jockeying with J.P. Morgan for top billing on the deal, was hurt by its work leading the Uber IPO, according to these people.

"West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled at two-week highs while Brent crude futures hit their highest levels since 2014 as Wall Street grew increasingly concerned over possible military actions in the Middle East.Brent crude futures rose $2.56 to $71.21 a barrel, a 3.7 percent gain, by 3:12 p.m. EDT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $2.09 to settle at $65.51 a barrel, a 3.3 percent gain.Geopolitical concerns elevated crude prices on Tuesday after President Donald Trump canceled his scheduled trip to multiple South American countries to focus on the U.S. response to developments in Syria.The president met with military officials in the White House Monday to discuss the administration’s response to an alleged chemical weapons attack carried out by Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government against its own people.But future U.S. involvement in the Middle East could interrupt crude supply chains and make it difficult for producers to ship overseas, sparking a bid for oil on Tuesday. Adding to the tensions, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Tuesday that the country could be a part of an international response to the Syrian violence, Reuters reported.“There are headlines of a U.S. carrier group heading to the Middle East, the Saudis are looking for $80 Brent crude, and this is ahead of API inventories,” said Roberto Friedlander, head of energy trading at Seaport Global Securities. The “market [also] bounced this morning after the Chinese president’s more dovish comments on the trade war.”Shares of major energy stocks surged alongside crude. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) traded nearly 3.9 percent higher, on pace for its best day since Nov. 30, 2016.President Xi Jinping promised on Tuesday to open China’s economy further, lower import tariffs on cars and better enforce international laws governing intellectual property. Xi’s comments likely sought to temper growing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have been announcing tit-for-tat tariffs over the past two weeks.Both equity and oil markets rallied after the speech, while supposed safe havens such as U.S. Treasurys and gold slipped, supporting Wall Street’s thesis that a trade war between the economic superpowers is increasingly unlikely.Oil prices also traded higher Tuesday amid a report from Bloomberg News, which said that Saudi Arabian officials were seeking $80 a barrel on Brent crude to support the valuation of its energy giant, Aramco, before its initial public offering.Also helping were comments from Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who said oil cartel OPEC will continue to steward the market. The minister said he would seek an extension to the OPEC–Russia deal, which expires in December.The report comes a week after Crown Prince Mohammed first told Time magazine that he expected Aramco’s public launch to coincide with higher oil prices.“We believe oil prices will get higher in this year and also get higher in 2019, so we are trying to pick the right time,” the prince told Time in reference to the IPO.

"Saudi Arabia has wrapped up a long-running corruption probe that captured the market’s attention in 2017 after the kingdom detained dozens of prominent princes and businessmen.The Saudi Royal Court on Wednesday said the kingdom has retrieved more than 400 billion Saudi riyals — or about $106 billion — in cash, real estate and other assets.The wave of arrests in November 2017 caught the world by surprise and turned the Ritz-Carlton in the capital city of Riyadh into a gilded prison for the scores of Saudis swept up in the campaign.The kingdom cast the detentions as part of a crackdown on entrenched corruption, while some observers said the detentions were orchestrated to consolidate power under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the next in line to King Salman bin Abdulaziz. Prince Mohammed chaired the corruption committee.Allegations of abuse and reports that detainees were being asked to exchange their assets for freedom rattled the market at a time when Saudi Arabia was accelerating its bid to attract foreign investment. The arrests came just days after the Saudis hosted an inaugural international investment summit in Riyadh.Among the prominent detainees were Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, Saudi Arabia’s most prominent investor, and Prince Mutaib al-Saud, the former head of the country’s National Guard.Concerns about Prince Mohammed’s rule following the arrests were compounded one year later when Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi went missing after entering a Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. After initially denying any responsibility, the kingdom admitted Saudi agents had killed Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and U.S. resident, inside the consulate.The Saudis say the killing was the act of rogue operatives, but the CIA has reportedly concluded the slaying was premeditated and Prince Mohammed was likely complicit.The Khashoggi crisis led many companies, including CNBC, to drop out of the second annual investment summit in Riyadh in November. While the killing has raised questions about foreign direct investment into Saudi Arabia, a recent Saudi bond sale attracted heavy international interest.The arrests in 2017 came as the kingdom sought to raise about $100 billion — the same amount netted in the crackdown — by listing shares of state energy giant Aramco. The long-delayed initial public offering has been pushed off to 2021, according to Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih. The funds from the IPO were meant to underwrite Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, an ambitious plan to overhaul the nation’s oil-dependent economy. Prince Mohammed is overseeing the agenda, creating reputational risk for companies partnering with the young leader to bring the plan to fruition.During the course of the corruption investigation, the committee summoned 381 individuals, though some were only brought before the panel to testify, the royal court said on Wednesday. The proceedings resulted in 87 settlements with Saudis who confessed to charges.The Saudi public prosecutor refused to settle with 56 people who faced prior criminal charges, according to the court. Another eight individuals rejected settlements and have been referred to the prosecutor for further action.",pos

"It can be hard to keep up with the headlines flying out of .Several members of the royal family and important Saudi businessmen were suddenly and unexpectedly arrested in a broad roundup over the weekend. And the president of the United States is dashing off late-night tweets, trying to get the Kingdom to bestow a tremendous, highly anticipated stock offering to Wall Street.Here’s the background:Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal is one of the most internationally famous members of the Saudi royal family — but that doesn’t necessarily make him popular at home. In fact, reports indicate he was arrested over the weekend along with other top Saudis in a supposed anti-corruption crackdown.Bin Talal is a billionaire investor who runs Kingdom Holdings and owns large stakes in companies like Twitter and News Corp. He comments regularly on Western television, speaking to CNBC just in October about the future of bitcoin and electric vehicles.The billionaire is U.S.-educated and a philanthropist: In 2015, Bin Talal announced he would donate his entire fortune to help build a “better world of tolerance, acceptance, equality and opportunity for all.”Although Saudi officialdom is characterizing the weekend’s arrests as part of a fight against corruption, many see the surprise detentions as a power play by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.The prince, 32, has made a meteoric rise from relative obscurity to his father King Salman’s direct heir and top advisor. He is overseeing the anti-corruption push, which was announced just a few hours before the first arrests were made.Bin Salman leads the Kingdom’s “Vision 2030” and the related “National Transformation Plan” — a program aimed at diversifying the Saudi economy beyond oil production. He is believed to have played a key role in  Riyadh’s decision to isolate Qatar.“This is the latest act of concentration of power in Saudi,” said Hasnain Malik, global head of equity research at investment bank Exotix Capital, adding that “as unprecedented and controversial as it may be, this centralisation might also be a necessary condition for pushing the austerity and transformation agenda” Bin Salman is overseeing.In June, Saudi Arabia removed then-crown prince Muhammad Bin Nayef from his role and replaced him with Bin Salman.That move immediately made the target on Bin Salman’s back even bigger, and could have precipitated an intra-family power struggle.Prior roles for Bin Salman include both defense minister and deputy crown prince, and he was earlier this year credited with a  “huge success” after President Donald Trump made a decision to visit Saudi Arabia.Trump has ties to both the Crown Prince Bin Salman and the billionaire investor Bin Talal.In addition to having likely orchestrated Trump’s trip to Saudi Arabia, Bin Salman has reportedly developed a relationship with White House advisor Jared Kushner — the husband of the president’s daughter and another 30-something man who has ridden family connections to the center of the world stage.In fact, Kushner made a  secretive trip to Saudi Arabia last week — just days before Bin Salman’s sweeping set of arrests.As for Bin Talal, he and the president go back at least to the 1990s.Between 1991 and 1995, Bin Talal  came to the rescue of Trump, whose real estate empire was in financial trouble. Bin Talal purchased a yacht from the New York real estate mogul and was part of a group that helped take the city’s floundering Plaza Hotel off Trump’s hands.But things have not been amicable between the two billionaires of late.In 2015, Bin Talal bashed Trump for his rhetoric during the presidential campaign, and even called for him to drop out.“You are a disgrace not only to the GOP but to all America,” he said in a Twitter post. “Withdraw from the U.S presidential race as you will never win.”Trump responded: “Dopey Prince @Alwaleed_Talal wants to control our U.S. politicians with daddy’s money. Can’t do it when I get elected. #Trump2016”The United States has many reasons to be interested in Saudi Arabia, including its oil and the central role it plays in Middle East politics, but the president has in the last two days zeroed in on something more specific: a win for Wall Street.Trump called for the Kingdom to have Saudi Aramco, its state oil company, list shares on a U.S. stock exchange. That IPO is expected to be the biggest in history, and it has had exchanges around the world scrambling to land it.Trump said over the weekend in a Twitter post that he hopes the IPO will go to the New York Stock Exchange. He then followed up, telling reporters aboard Air Force One that the Saudi king had told him “they will consider using U.S. exchanges.”—CNBC’s Nyshka Chandran and Javier David and Reuters contributed to this report.",pos

" Real estate is now  a prime play for sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) as equity markets  remain unpredictable, said an analyst Wednesday.  The Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute president Michael Maduell  said, “They are looking for long-term investments where they can  lock up their capital and not have to continually reinvest that  capital.” The institute analyzes investments by public asset  owners such as SWFs and other long-term governmental investors.  Vehicles such as pension funds and endowments are also increasing  investing in real estate and infrastructure, he told CNBC’s  “Squawk Box” on  Wednesday.  For example, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global increased  its allocation of real estate and was looking at core property  markets in Asia, opening offices in Tokyo and Singapore, noted  Maduell. The country’s sovereign wealth fund is the largest in  the world, with more than $830 billion in AUM.   Despite the uncertain market outlook, sovereign wealth funds  increased assets under management (AUM) by $200 billion from a  year ago to $6.5 trillion in March 2016, information provider  Preqin said in a recent report. Commodities funds have taken a hit from the shift into real estate and other more  stable investments, with SWF holdings dropping 50 percent in  March, according to Preqin’s research. Also, with oil prices remaining low, exporting countries have liquidated assets in order to free up money for government spending, Preqin said.  Another big development in the space was the listing of Saudi  Aramco, the state-owned oil company, Maduell said.   Saudi Arabia confirmed on Monday that it planned to sell a stake of its state oil giant  Saudi Aramco, which was expected to be valued at more than $2  trillion. Proceeds from the sale will go into setting up a sovereign wealth fund designed to diversify the oil-reliant country’s investments.Less than 5 percent of the company would be made available via an initial public offering (IPO), Deputy Crown Prince  Mohammed bin Salman said in an interview with the Al  Arabiya News Channel.

"  Oil prices could go under $40 a barrel, if the Organization of  the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut agreement  doesn’t get worked out, according to one expert.  The group will likely get its planned production deal done,  but Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC  Capital Markets, said the agreement won’t be finalized until the  last minute.  “I think they’ll get it done, but I think they’ll get it done  right before November 30,” Croft said on CNBC’s  “Power Lunch” on Monday.  Oil prices were under pressure on Monday amid market reservations  about whether the deal will go through. U.S. West Texas  Intermediate crude futures settled down 3.78 percent at  $46.86 a barrel, while international Brent crude futures were also trading south of $50 a barrel.  Croft explained that even if the deal happens, there are a lot of  preliminary meetings between now and the big day, which will  create “a lot of noise of negative headlines.”  One thing that gives Croft assurance, however, is  that heavyweight Saudi Arabia has an incentive to help the OPEC  deal along. It’s in the country’s “best interest to have oil  above $50” a barrel for its planned initial public offering of a  part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco, said Croft, who is also a CNBC contributor.She explained that an OPEC agreement to limit oil production would “firm the case” for higher oil prices.  “This IPO is a very big policy priority for the deputy crown  prince of Saudi Arabia. I think Saudi Arabia is incentivized to  make this work,” Croft said.",neg
"A small town in the Swiss Alps is overrun for a week every winter by the biggest global names in business, finance and politics. Davos, site of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting, also attracts its fair share of philanthropists, academics, artists, activists and visionaries. Microsoft founder Bill Gates is an excellent example of those who attend; he’s a businessman, investor, billionaire, innovator and philanthropist (along with his wife and partner, Melinda.) This year, the Davos meeting will focus on a “world that is becoming increasingly complex and interconnected but also experiencing an erosion of common values and principles,” according to the WEF program, which seems wholly familiar in the post-financial crisis global economy. Click ahead to see some of the players who’ll appear in Davos during the confab Jan. 26-30.By Albert BozzoPosted 21 Jan 2011Paul Bulcke - CEO, Nestle (Switz.) Chanda Kochar - CEO, ICICI (India) Davos always assembles an interesting and diverse group of co-chairs. The six this year provide ample geographic breath. Bulcke and Kochar essentially represent two key regions of the world. Other co-chairs are from China, Japan, the U.S. and Sweden. Nestle and Mitsubishi are top-shelf global brands with a variety of products. Bulcke, a Belgian, has never worked for anyone other than Nestle, but befitting a global company has worked on several continents, including North America, where he headed the revenue-rich US unit. Kochar, named CEO in 2009, runs India’s largest private bank and is considered one of the world’s most powerful women. ICICI, formerly known as Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India, has a presence in 19 countries. David Cameron, Prime Minister of the UK George Papandreou, Prime Minister of Greece For those in politics and government, Davos has been a celebrated stage for decades, serving newcomers and veterans alike. For Cameron, like others before him, the meeting offers a global debut for the UK’s first Conservative Party Prime Minister of this century. For Papandreou, it’s a easy opportunity to show leadership, put a human (and brave) face on the Greek drama and talk to private investors, NGO chiefs and government leaders alike. Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB President (France) Robert Zoellick, President, The World Bank (U.S.) These two will certainly be interested in Greece’s finances. Trichet has been a Davos headliner for years, unlike his American counterparts. The Frenchman’s term at the European Central Bank ends in October of this year, so this may be his swan song. Zoellick, whose term ends in 2012. is among the many Goldman Sachs alumni to embrace public service, having served as trade rep, and deputy secretary of state under George W. Bush James Dimon, Chairman & CEO, JPMorgan Chase (US) Brian T. Moynihan, CEO & Pres, Bank of America (US) It being Switzerland, you’ll find quite a few bankers in the crowd. Dimon, a former co-chair in 2009, has been a regular for years. He’s also developed a reputation as a candid, charismatic and periodically caustic speaker. Moynihan, stout and rugged -- in keeping with his college years as a rugby player -- is back at Davos, after his debut last year, which came shortly after he replaced the controversial and courtly Ken Lewis. Unlike Dimon, Moynihan has something to prove and Davos is a good place to win admirers. Josef Ackerman , Chairman & CEO, Deutschebank (Germany) Jean-Paul Chifflet, CEO, Credit Agricole (France) These two banks, among Europe’s largest, have felt the fallout from Greece in the sovereign debt crisis. Ackerman, who’s Swiss, spent years at Credit Suisse before moving to the German giant where he spearheaded the merger with Bankers Trust of the US. Ackerman is credited with making the bank more shareholder friendly and has been outspoken about Greece’s debt burden. Chiffert took over in 2010, leaving behind his vineyard near Lyon. The bank has a big business in Greece and is expanding in Italy. Larry Page, Co-founder, CEO, Google (U.S.) Eric Schmidt, Chairman, Google (U.S.) Google being Google, the company requires a slide of its own. What’s better than a mountain setting for a company whose stock has reached such heights and stands above the tech titans? Of course, Page and Schmidt may not be spending that mugh time together in Davos, seeing as how the company just announced Page would assume Schmidt’s CEO role in April. José Carreras, Spanish TenorAaron Koblin, Digital Artist (U.S.) Artists are often acknowledged, and sometimes celebrated, at Davos simply for their work. Others in the past have come with a social or political agenda (Bono, Angelina Jolie). Spain’s José Carreras, one of the so-called “Three Tenors”, is an opera star with a mission. A leukemia survivor, Carreras founded the  José Carerras International Leukemia Foundation more than 20 years ago.Koblin, who at 28 already has a piece in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, specializes in data visualization and is Technology Lead of Google’s Creative Lab. Stephen A . Schwarzman, Chairrman & CEO, The Blackstone Group George Soros, Chairman, Soros Fund Management Big-name investors are always on scene at Davos, and Schwarzman and Soros are familiar faces. Schwarzman, who recently relocated to Paris for awhile, is one of the wealthiest individuals in the world, even though his his hedge fund is trading at about half its IPO value of 3 1/2 years ago. Soros’ investments don’t make headlines the way they did a couple of decades ago, but the financier himself often does, especially at Davos. Soros is now known as much for his philanthropy and support for the Democratic Party as he is his investment prowess. Nouriel Roubini, Professor, NYU Stern (U.S.) Lawrence Summers, Professor, Harvard University (U.S.) The academics of today are in many cases players as much as observers, and in some cases move in and out of government. Former White House advisor and Treasury Secretary Summers is back at the meeting, having just left the Obama administration. Look for some of his customary blunt comments. Roubini, who earned the name “Dr. Doom And Gloom” because of his prescient yet pessimistic analysis of the financial crisis, will no doubt be in great demand, as he was last year. Fred Krupp, co-founder & Pres. of the Environmental Defense Fund (U.S.) Salil Shetty, Secretary General, Amnesty International (India) Applause for a cause is also a Davos staple, whether it’s peace in the Middle East, the end of apartheid or simply clean water. Krupp’s audience has grown in recent years as both governments and companies adopt alternative energy and sustainability practices. He’s also had a hand in the UN’s Kyoto Protocol and other major green initiatives. Shetty, who took over in mid 2010, is the first Indian to head the civil rights group, which turns 50 this year. Amnesty wrestled with WikiLeaks last year when it asked the whistle-blowing outfit to remove names from leaked Afghan War logs because of concern the Taliban would assassinate them Shi Zhengrong, Chrmn & CEO, Suntech Power (China) Ditlev Engel, CEO & Pres. Vestas Wind Systems (Denmark) Alternative energy is no longer on the fringe and two leading companies will be represented at Davos. Shi founded the world’s leading supplier of crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules, which has customers in some 80 countries and trades on the NYSE, and is a symbol of China’s ascension in the solar industry Europe is the leader in wind power, and Denmark’s Vestas is the largest producer, seller and installer of wind turbines. Engel has lead the company since 2005, overseeing its boom. Jose Sergio Gabrielli de Azevedo, CEO & Pres., Petrobras (Brazil) Khalid A. Al-Falih, CEO & Pres. Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia) Energy prices and big oil will certainly get more attention than a year ago, when the global recession choked demand and kept prices low. No doubt enjoying the recent run-up are Azevedo and Al-Falih. Brazil is a rising star in the oil industry and Azevedo is at the helm of an the largest corporation in South America. A former university professor, Azevedo became CEO of the semi-private state oil company in 2005. Al-Falih became CEO of the world’s largest oil company based on market cap in 2009, having worked there for more than 30 years. He received a degree in mechanical engineering from Texas A&M University. Dimtri Medvedev, President of Russia Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of Indonesia Two other energy powerhouses will be represented at Davos by their heads of government. Medvedev became Rusisia’s third president in 2008 and has made economic modernization a priority. He is also a former chairman of the board at Gazprom and top aide to Vladimir Putin.(Medvedev delayed his departure Monday because of the Moscow airport bombing.) Yudhoyono is serving his second term as president of the world’s fifth most populous country and influential OPEC member. A former military general, Yudhoyono’s forged a free trade agreement with Japan in 2007.John T. Chambers, CEO & Pres. Cisco Systems (US) Yang Yuanqing, CEO, Lenovo (China) Chambers and Cisco are riding high again, capitalizing on the networking boom, as well as an aggressive approach to clean tech Chambers has compared the green space to the Internet, calling it the key to US future. He’s a Davos veteran. Yang is on his second tour as CEO, having held that post when Lenovo acquired IBM’s PC business in 2005. He’s considered one of Chinas’ top entrepreneurs and managers, having made Lenovo the country’s top selling PC since 1997.Azim Premji, Founder & Chairman, Wipro Ltd (India) S. (Kris) Gopalakrishnan, CEO Infosys Technologies (India) These two firms symbolize India’s ascension in IT. Premji is one of the richest men in the world and is also known a as philanthropist. The company started out in food oils and consumer products, later branching into software with Wipro Technologies. Gopalakrishnan helped found Infosys in 1981 and became CEO in 2007. Lakshmi N. Mittal Chairman & CEO Arcelor/Mittal (India/UK) Carlos Ghosn, Chairman & CEO, Renault-Nissan Alliance (Brazil) These two companies personify the global economy, applying cross-border mergers and alliances to grow and succeed. Mittal has become one of the richest men in the world through a series of steel industry acquisitions The company has operations in 18 countries and its stock trades in half a dozen countries. A Lebanese Brazilian-born executive running a French-Japanese company, that’s Ghosn. First, he turned around a money-hemorrhaging Nissan. Then, in 1999, he formed a cross-shareholding arrangement with Renault of France, creating the world’s third largest automaker. Indra Nooyi, Chairman & CEO of PepsiCo Robert Polet, CEO & President of Gucci Group Consumer products giants cross national boundaries perhaps like no others. So, what’s wrong with a little fizz and style at Davos? Nooyi, a former chair at Davos, played strategic roles in the companies restructuring and acquisitions before taking over the corner office in 2007, and has presided over the company’s earnings surge. Polet spent almost three decades at Unilever (ice cream and frozen foods) before taking over at the style icon, a unit of France’s PPP, in 2004. Polet is credited with reviving the company’s fortunes. Shimon Peres, President of Israel Jacob G. Zuma, President of South Africa Davos has a United Nations-like quality to it. For every world leader, there’s a head of state or government from a smaller, yet influential country. Peres, nearing 90, has been to Davos wearing many hats over the years. He’s one of the rare people to be both head of state and government, having served two terms as prime minister, and lived through the best and worst of times in Israel’s history. Like another president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela, Zuma was imprisoned and exiled before becoming a member of parliament in post-apartheid South Africa. Zuma became president in 2009, following a power struggle to succeed President Thabo Mbeki.",pos

"This year could mark a comeback for commodities, with oil potentially hitting $80 per barrel, a portfolio manager said on Wednesday.Restrained production among major oil producers and the “greater impetus” to maintain stability ahead of the widely-anticipated initial public offering of Saudi Aramco will support prices further this year, said Yoon Chou Chong, head of Asian equities at Natixis Asset Management.“We’ve done a lot through the exporters, tech and we’re still happy with them. (But) I think this might be the year for the return of the commodities, the oil,” Chong told CNBC. He named commodities as a top trade for 2018.“The $80-mark ... (doesn’t) sound too preposterous, actually,” he added.Oil prices opened the year above $60 a barrel — the strongest start to a calendar year since 2014. Both crude oil benchmarks — the U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and globally traded Brent — rose amid production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and anti-government protests in Iran.Oil prices last hit $80 per barrel in in November 2014. Both WTI and Brent collapsed from above $100 per barrel in June 2014 to around $30 a barrel in January 2016 due to weak demand, a strong dollar and booming U.S. shale production.OPEC, along with other oil producers such as Russia, has curbed the supply of crude since January last year. The output cuts will be extended until the end of this year.Separately, Chong said Asian stocks could extend their gains this year. In particular, he said he likes Chinese stocks such as tech firm and exporters, both of which are still “not too expensive.” However, he said he would stay away from the region’s utilities and telecom stocks.Chong, like many other investors, downplayed risks to financial markets from North Korea’s nuclear threats. He said that shifts in monetary policy globally will have a greater impact on where investors park their money.“Investors have been taking it (North Korean risks) with a pinch of salt and assume that sanity will prevail eventually,” Chong said. “I think people will act rationally in the end. There are big interested parties — South Korea, China and the U.S. — whom I think wouldn’t want (any catastrophe) to happen.”— CNBC’s  contributed to this report",pos
"Is the oil barrel half empty or half full? In the past week you had your pick of answers to choose from, and they were bookended nicely from the week’s beginning to its end.The missile and drone attack on the largest Saudi Arabian oil-refining operation, which resulted in the largest single-day gain for crude oil ever on Monday, reminded a world that had gone a long time without a geopolitical shock how central the role of oil remains.By Thursday, though, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos — a man whose every latest decision is equated with doom for whoever is on the other side of the competition — announced his company would reach a goal of carbon neutrality by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris Agreement goal. Bezos said 10,000 electric-delivery vehicles will be on the roads in just three years (2022) and 80% of Amazon will be operating on renewable energy by as early as 2024. By 2030 all of Amazon and 100,000 delivery trucks will be 100% powered by renewable energy. On the same day, Google announced it was investing $2 billion in new renewable-energy projects, a record corporate purchase.One day later millions around the world took to the streets — including Amazon and Google employees — in a climate strike ahead of UN Climate Week. “The plain truth is that capitalism needs to evolve if humanity is going to survive,” Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario wrote on LinkedIn.You could add the fact that Duke Energy — the largest utility in the U.S., which for years had resisted renewables — announced this week that it would reach an interim target of 50% carbon emission reductions by 2030, 100% by 2050. Or that Daimler, credited with inventing the modern gasoline engine, announced it will cease all research and development related to internal combustion in favor of electrification.And that was just one week.For more on iconic global companies and executives embracing change and transforming for the future, join us live on Sept. 24 in Chicago at CNBC Evolve, a summit for business decision makers seeking to innovate.But none of this week’s events mean as much to the energy market as two recent milestones in the S&P 500. These stock market technicals did not make as much noise but speak volumes about crude oil.Exxon Mobil dropped out of the S&P 500′s top 10 stocks for the first time in nine decades, and the energy sector weighting in the S&P 500 hit a low of roughly 4%. Yes, oil and gas is a boom-and-bust sector and its valuation can be volatile, but the sector has not had a weighting this low based on S&P 500 data in four decades.That poses a question that no one can answer with conviction, but it won’t be going away: Are we beginning to see signs of the end of Big Oil as an investment stalwart, regardless of what’s still sitting in the underground reserves around the world?Sam Margolin, managing director and senior analyst at Wolfe Research covering energy sector stocks, said with some investors the oil industry has become its own hurdle, and the general fear about where the world is heading supersedes the need to be certain about a peak oil timeline.“To the extent anyone says, ‘I can’t look at the sector because I have no long-term confidence in oil as an energy source,’ what is interesting about those comments is that the time frame is not relevant. Someone will say, ‘Oil will be used in 10 years but I don’t know about 20 or 50.’ It is just at some point in the future it will be out of the mix, and that’s a hurdle to overcome, and there are investors like that. It’s not universal, and there are just as many people on the other side who say the next shortage will come sooner than anyone expects.”One way to discount any correlation between the sector’s S&P 500 decline and general investor souring on energy is to focus on how big the technology industry has become. As the weighting of the biggest U.S. tech companies have grown and consumed more of the total market return, other weightings decline.Over the past five-year period, 30% of the S&P 500 return was generated by the five biggest technology stocks — Alphabet, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.“The rest of the market has been getting bigger and leaving energy companies behind,” Margolin said. “The market cap of Exxon Mobil is not lower than it was 20 years ago. It is just that the rest of the market has tripled.”The stock market weighting is not the only place where this shift from energy to tech is evident. In 1982, when the Forbes 400 list was first published, 89 of the 400 richest Americans had made their fortunes in oil. By 2018, 59 of the Forbes 400 had made their fortunes in technology, including six of the top 10, Bezos among them.But oil has been down before, just never by this much in the S&P 500.“This is not the first time oil prices have been in the $50–$60 range, and yet the energy weighting is significantly less than it had been in the past,” said Stewart Glickman, energy analyst at CFRA. When oil was trading between $50 and $60 during 2005 and 2006, the world was a different place. “Now alternative energy is a threat. It is still not a threat that renewables in a really significant way are taking over for fossil fuels,” he said, noting that the intermittent generation of solar and wind and scaling of energy-storage solutions remain challenges. “But people are worried,” Glickman said. “They’ve lost the growth investors even if they still have dividend investors.”“I don’t dismiss it as much as other people might,” said Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research who worked in energy research earlier in his career on Wall Street. “I remember the first oil shock [of the 1970s] vividly. People who were 50-plus retail investors with capital to invest would be shocked to see where oil is in the S&P as a sector now. It is just not as interesting a place to invest. ... Venture capital money isn’t going into carbon-based energy.”“Stocks that have really worked are the ones where there is consensus,” Margolin said. “Everyone knows online transaction counts are going higher, or streaming subscribers going higher. There is no consensus on a positive direction for oil.”More money also has been going into passive index funds. For the first time in August, U.S. index mutual fund assets matched the total assets under management in actively managed mutual funds. The adoption of environmental, social and governance screens by many passive fund managers is beginning to contribute to lower weightings for fossil-fuel companies.“Oil and gas does not screen well, so as passive grows that is another headwind,” Margolin said. “Passive has no flexibility with respect to ESG. You could go into the office of a human portfolio manager and convince them that Exxon is working to lower their carbon footprint. You can explain that to a human, but not a robot.”In fact, investors no longer need to accept any weighting to energy stocks. The amount of money invested in U.S.-based fossil-fuel free funds — investments constructed to hold no stocks in the fossil fuel business — has reached $100 billion, according to shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. “You’re hands are no longer tied,” said Andrew Behar, CEO of As You Sow.“It’s obviously out of favor, and there is influence from ESG investors no matter what oil prices are doing,” Glickman said.Some energy analysts say technology’s dominance will only grow as a long-term, and direct, threat.“Investors are worried that oil demand will peak and the sector is not ready for it. Same as in European electricity, coal, autos and GE. The fear is that this is not just another cycle but a structural shift,” said Kingsmill Bond, CFA and energy strategist at Carbon Tracker, a nonprofit that researches the impact of climate change on the financial markets. “The oil sector is just another example of an incumbency disrupted by superior technology. Markets have seen this many times and it does not play out well for the incumbents.”Colas said while he remains unconvinced, analysts calling this the “Peak Oil” moment — Carbon Tracker’s Bond is among them — have the upper hand for now. “From an investment standpoint, it seems prescient now that prices just won’t lift.”After the attack on the Saudi oil infrastructure crude ended the week up near-6%; the energy stock sector within the S&P 500 was up 0.99%, according to CNBC data.The next market where the disruptive potential is highest may be natural-gas fired power generation. If the past decade was about natural gas displacing coal in the utility sector, the next decade will be a competition between natural gas and renewables including wind and solar, say analysts.“We are just now shifting our focus to the competition between natural gas and renewable energy,” said Travis Miller, utilities analyst at Morningstar. “Renewables were the sideshow as natural gas competed with coal, but we see natural gas and renewables increasingly competing with each other. Increasingly, there are a number of cases where it is more advantageous for customers and utilities to invest in solar and wind versus natural gas. Rewind to a decade ago and all the utilities were talking about natural gas.”The CEO of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company said recently, “The surprise was how dramatically the renewables and storage proposals beat natural gas. I couldn’t have predicted this five years ago.”Exxon Mobil and its oil peers are heavily invested in natural gas projects around the world. While that means big bets on the liquified natural gas market won’t be influenced by a faster shift in U.S. power generation, the cost equation is going to change globally.“The concern is going straight from coal to renewables,” Margolin said. “It looks unlikely because of the scale of renewable investment required, but we are going into a period of time when we know eventually the world will be off oil; we don’t know if the same can be said of natural gas.”Royal Dutch Shell is the biggest global player in the liquified natural gas market and it expects gas demand to double by 2035 from current levels, which would imply a big supply shortfall and much more investment needed to meet that demand. “The vast majority is for power generation,” said energy research firm Wood Mackenzie analyst Luke Parker.A recent report from the Rocky Mountain Institute argues that the investments being made today in gas-fired power plants and pipelines will quickly become a money loser. Utilities and investors have announced plans for over $70 billion in new gas-fired power plant construction through 2025, but its research suggests that 90% of the proposed capacity is more costly than equivalent clean energy portfolio options for utilities.Battery storage costs — key to making intermittent sources of power like solar more reliable as a primary part of the grid — are also expected to fall drastically. From 2010-2018 lithium-ion battery costs declined by 85% and they are forecast to decline by another 50% by 2030, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, with major implications for the utility and electric vehicle market.Announcements like Amazon’s purchase of 100,000 electric delivery vans are good for every player in the battery market, said former Ford CEO Mark Fields on CNBC, as the increase in battery production will drive down pricing more broadly.Before Duke Energy’s commitment this week there was Xcel Energy in Minnesota, the first U.S. utility to say it was on the path to 100% renewable power generation. It had been one of the heaviest coal generators in the U.S., but also sits in a geographic footprint which maps with high wind potential, Miller said. “They have completely transitioned from coal to natural gas and now, in last two years, to an entire focus on renewables.”A critical part of this shift for utility companies is getting all the stakeholders on board, he said, and the Xcel example shows that is happening, with regulatory support and customer support to invest substantially in renewables.“We think solar will be the story of next decade,” Miller said. “The big winners will be investing heavily in renewables now. Companies that come to the table in a decade are going to be losers. They will be stuck with stranded assets.”Natural gas will continue to be a huge part of the U.S. grid, up from one-third of generation not to as much as 40% in the next five years, but Miller said “it is looking more like bridge fuel rather than the primary fuel we thought it would be a decade ago. Everyone foresaw challenges coal faced. I don’t think people saw the speed at which renewables would become such a primary source of investment in the generation business.”The oil and gas management teams at companies like BP and Shell are talking a lot more about energy transformation. A recent analysis of presentations and investor calls done by Wood Mackenzie’s Parker found an “exponential increase” in use of terms like “energy transition.”“Energy transition terminology has gone from zero or near to zero five years ago to one of dominant themes of messaging to investors, and that speaks volumes about how investors have moved, and how companies are having to move themselves,” Parker said. But he added “actions speak louder than words” and the low-carbon investments relative to the traditional oil and gas investments on the balance sheet of these companies are “still a fraction.”Shell is planning to spend $2 billion to $3 billion annually on renewable energy out of a total budget of $30 billion per year through 2025. On average, oil and gas companies are spending 1% of their budget on renewables.There’s a simple reason why: they still make a lot more money from fossil-fuel extraction, including in the U.S. shale plays.“There is no renewable investment that will compete with returns from the Permian Basin,” Parker said.“With major oil and gas cos like Exxon and Chevron, the reason they keep reinvesting in oil and gas at this rate over renewables is not a philosophical thing,” said Margolin. “They invest because this is where they see the financial case and if ever there is a clear signal the return profile was better in renewables, they would go there.” He added, “The difference between them and a Kodak or a coal company is that they have much better resources, and $40 billion in cash flow annually with which they can pivot between projects. ... I see where are people tempted to make the analogy to other disrupted industries, but these others don’t have the financial might of Exxon.”Shell’s investment will be a good test case of whether the oil and gas majors can generate comparable returns on investment from renewables. “Stable cash flows of offshore wind may be exactly what investors looking for in a super major to mitigate the type of risk we saw last weekend,” Parker said.A record-setting auction for offshore wind power projects in the U.K. this past week priced them at lower rates than current coal and natural gas generation prices in the U.K.“Shell has the scope to make competitive returns in this area and they would not be investing if they did not think so, but at the same time, clearly the amount they are talking about energy transition and renewables versus the actual focus of the here and now is disproportionate,” Parker said.The $2 to $3 billion Shell plans to spend on renewable investments per year compares to $125 billion in dividends and share buybacks Shell plans to deliver to investors between 2021 and 2025.That’s not a surprise: analysts say as the commodity case for energy stocks has failed to compel investors, the oil and gas companies need to find other ways to attract their money. On its last earnings call with analysts, Exxon Mobil conceded under questioning that it had been holding meetings with investors asking about their interest in a buyback of its shares.With geopolitical tensions rising after the attack on Saudi oil operations and the U.S. government contemplating its next move against Iran, which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia claim was behind the attack, the 6% rise in oil in the past week could turn into an extended risk premium in oil.Energy is cyclical, but time is not on the side of fossil fuels in the long run, and that means with each cycle during which it underperforms, the clock is ticking in a way it does not for other sectors. “It’s been a chronically bad performer for several years,” Glickman said.The loss of confidence among many investors stems from the most recent overspending period when oil prices were higher. From 2011 to 2014, crude oil traded above $85 a barrel. By 2015, it was in the low $40s.“Investors were burned,” Colas said. “100% of complaints go back to 2011 and 2012. They lost all credibility. The lack of faith is not quite as bad as WeWork or Uber, but it will take oil going back to $85 and the drillers not going crazy for belief to come back. Any cyclical company that went through a near-death experience has to show the market they are more disciplined.”Glickman said the companies have “found religion” since prices bottomed in 2016 in the $30s. “They made substantial changes.”That has translated into stronger cash flow and earnings acceleration, but it has not translated into the one market indicator of renewed investor conviction: higher stock multiples.“The industry has a pretty checkered history when prices get better. Lack of trust,” Glickman said. “Exploration and production companies are making more money and integrated oil and gas companies are generating good cash flows, but the changes have not manifest into demand for the stocks yet. All the stocks are languishing.”It may take a significant rise in oil prices to dispel the belief of energy experts who are inclined to judge the current period as being one more cyclical trough.“If oil rises significantly and the stocks have not performed then clearly there is a question about long-term sustainability of the industry. But I don’t think you can ask that question today,” Margolin said. “We are dealing with a short duration of history here.”It is also a period of time during which U.S. production growth has disrupted the global market balance. “This has been viewed as something that was possible only for the last four of five years. ... We have no track record of sustaining this level of supply growth at any price,” he said.Calling peak oil has been a fool’s errand for over a century. When the first U.S. oil bonanza began in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in the late 1850s many in the press were confident that it would be the beginning, and the end, of the U.S. oil boom.But the conversation has changed.“Peak oil used to be a conversation about supply running out, but now it is about demand peaking,” Parker said.“In the future, exploration is largely redundant — at least for the purposes of adding resource — even in a modest demand growth scenario,” Wood Mackenzie analysts wrote in a recent report. “The world does not have a supply problem. The world is awash with oil and the Majors know it.”The report went on: “The fundamental question is this: will industry forecasts for sustained oil demand growth ‘prevail’ over scientific warnings of the consequences of that growth? At this point, we simply cannot know. But one thing is for certain — neither companies nor investors can afford to bet the farm on either outcome.”Carbon Tracker’s Bond sees in the planned Saudi Aramco IPO, whose timing has been thrown into question by last week’s attack, the ultimate tell that Peak Oil is here. “The largest oil IPO in history. At a time when there are fears of peak oil demand,” he said. “I don’t think I need to elaborate.”Though, roughly 160 years after Titusville, if anyone can stretch out the oil era to its most-delayed possible end, it is Saudi Arabia.“The Saudis, along with the Russian and U.S. tight oil, these are the lowest-cost barrels in the world and they will still be producing. Canadian oil sands or frontier deepwater, or U.K. North Sea where there are high operating costs, go first. That’s where barrels first stay in the ground,” Parker said.And that already has started to happen. Exxon Mobil and other major oil companies including ConocoPhillips have had to write down existing reserves in Canadian tar sands, which the companies say is done for regulatory accounting purposes and can be reversed if prices rise, but others argue the debooking of assets should be viewed as a long-term read-through on demand.An August report from BNP Paribas forecasts that oil will have to go as law as $10 to be competitive with renewables in the electric car era. While the U.S. oil boom in the shale is such a recent phenomenon that analysts still struggle to understand exactly how much money these companies can make in various price scenarios, and have trouble placing too much faith in cost estimates offered by management, Saudi drilling is the lowest-cost in the world.That makes Parker certain of at least one thing when it comes to Saudi Arabia and arguments over peak oil demand. “They will be going to the end.”",pos
